Query with Attached paths: Look at the attached image. The quiz is scored as follows:

Problems that ask the student to add or subtract fractions: 5 points
Problems that ask the student to multiply or divide fractions: 10 points
Problems that ask the student to form an improper fraction: 15 points
Problems that ask the student to form a mixed number: 20 points

Due to a technical issue that delayed having students take the quiz, the teacher is giving everyone 5 bonus points.

If you graded the quiz in the attached image, how many points would the student have earned? There is no partial credit.
