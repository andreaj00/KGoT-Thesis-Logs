Query: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo.

I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

Query: I went to Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago for my birthday on March 22, 2021 and the main course I had was delicious!  Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.

    {neo4j_id:29, properties:{'description': 'The Principle of Double Effect (PDE) is a moral reasoning framework that originates from the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, particularly in his discussions on ethics and moral theology. This principle is often invoked in situations where an action has two effects: one that is intended and good, and another that is unintended and potentially harmful. The principle helps to evaluate the moral permissibility of actions that have both positive and negative consequences. Key Components of the Principle of Double Effect: 1. Nature of the Act: The action itself must be morally good or at least morally neutral. If the act is intrinsically evil, then it cannot be justified, regardless of the outcomes. 2. Intention: The agent must intend only the good effect, not the bad effect. The bad effect can be foreseen but must not be the means to achieving the good effect. This means that the intention behind the action is crucial; the good effect must be the primary goal. 3. Means-End Relationship: The bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved. In other words, the good outcome cannot be obtained by directly causing the bad outcome. The good effect must arise independently of the bad effect. 4. Proportionality: There must be a proportionate reason for allowing the bad effect to occur. The good effect must outweigh the bad effect in terms of moral significance. This consideration often involves weighing the consequences and determining whether the good that results justifies the harm that is caused. Application of the Principle: The Principle of Double Effect is often applied in various ethical dilemmas, particularly in medical ethics, warfare, and end-of-life decisions. Here are a few examples: - Medical Ethics: In cases where a patient may require a treatment that alleviates suffering but also has the side effect of hastening death (such as administering high doses of painkillers), the principle can be used to justify the action if the intention is to relieve suffering and not to cause death. - Warfare: In military contexts, an attack on a legitimate military target may result in collateral damage to civilians. The principle can be invoked to argue that if the intention is to disable a military threat and the harm to civilians is unintended and proportionate to the military advantage gained, then the action may be morally permissible. Conclusion: The Principle of Double Effect provides a nuanced approach to moral decision-making in complex situations where actions can lead to both good and bad outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of intention, the nature of the act, and the proportionality of effects, allowing for a careful ethical analysis that respects the complexity of human actions and their consequences. While it is a valuable tool in moral theology and ethics, its application can be contentious and often requires careful consideration of the specific circumstances involved.', 'name': 'Principle of Double Effect'}}

Solving question 160:
file_names: ['']
Query: In NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon.
