You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.

You are a formatter and extractor. Your task is to combine partial solution from a database and format them according to the initial problem statement.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Understand the initial problem, the problem nuances, the desired output, and the desired output format.
2. Review the provided partial solution.
3. Integrate and elaborate on the various pieces of information from the partial solution to produce a complete solution to the initial problem. Do not invent any new information.
4. Format the complete solution according to the desired output specified in the initial problem. Pay extra attention to any required format nuances. Ensure the solution is clear and concise. Do not add any more information than required.
5. Remove any additional comments surrounding the final answer unless required by the problem. Be as concise as possible.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>

<examples>
<example_1>
Initial problem: What are the preferred ice cream flavors in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.
</example_1>
<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Given partial solution:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

Solution: 68
Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000

Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

Initial problem: What are the preferred ice cream flavors in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.

<task>
You are a linguistic expert and a skilled problem solver. Your role is to select the best final solution from a list of options based on an initial problem and a partial solution provided.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the initial problem, its nuances, and the desired output format.
2. Review the partial solutions and the list of final formatted solutions.
3. Choose the most appropriate final solution.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

{
  "initial_query": "Calculate the total cost after a 20% discount on a $100 item.",
  "partial_solution": "'costs': 100, 'discount_percentage': 20"
}
Output: true
Explanation: The partial solution identifies the discount percentage but does not calculate the discounted amount.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "What is the area of a triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm?",
  "partial_solution": "'base': 5, 'height': 10"
}
Output: true
Explanation: The partial solution provides the necessary dimensions but does not calculate the area.
</example_2>

<example_3>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "How many people lived in Switzerland in 2022?",
  "partial_solution": "population: 8,766 million"
}
Output: false
Explanation: The partial solution already contains that the population of Switzerland in 2022 was of 8,766 million people.
</example_3>

<example_3>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "What is the probability of rolling at two six with two six-sided dice?",
  "partial_solution": "We roll two six-sided dice. There are 36 possible outcomes. and only one is made by two six"
}
Output: false
Explanation: The partial solution already contains that the probability is 1/36.
</example_3>

<example_4>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "List the steps to set up a new email account.",
  "partial_solution": "Go to the website, click on 'Create an account', fill out the form, and submit."
}
Output: false
Explanation: The task is procedural and does not require mathematical calculations.
</example_4>

<example_5>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "Explain the causes of World War I.",
  "partial_solution": "World War I was caused by ..."
}
Output: false
Explanation: The query is historical and explanatory, with no need for mathematical calculations.

In the June 2014 issue of this journal, Emily Midkiff wrote an article titled "Dragons and Jetpacks: Soaring through Genre in Children’s and Young Adult Fantasy Literature."

In her article, Midkiff discusses the portrayal of dragons in children's and young adult fantasy literature. She quotes two different authors who express their distaste for the nature of dragon depictions using the word "trite." This term is used to criticize the often clichéd and unoriginal portrayal of dragons in the genre.

You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

Initial problem: What are the preferred ice cream flavors in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.

<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Given partial solution:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000

Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

<task>
You are a formatter and extractor. Your task is to combine partial solution from a database and format them according to the initial problem statement.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Understand the initial problem, the problem nuances, the desired output, and the desired output format.
2. Review the provided partial solution.
3. Integrate and elaborate on the various pieces of information from the partial solution to produce a complete solution to the initial problem. Do not invent any new information.
4. Format the complete solution according to the desired output specified in the initial problem. Pay extra attention to any required format nuances. Ensure the solution is clear and concise. Do not add any more information than required.
5. Remove any additional comments surrounding the final answer unless required by the problem. Be as concise as possible.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

<examples>
<example_1>
Initial problem: What are the preferred ice cream flavors in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.
</example_1>
<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Given partial solution:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

Solution: 68
Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000

Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

Tropicos ID: 100370510

1*1 + 0*2 + 0*3 + 3*4 + 7*5 + 0*6 + 5*7 + 1*8 + 0*9 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 35 + 0 + 35 + 8 + 0 = 91

91 % 11 = 3

Therefore, the check digit is 3.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

Kettering, vice president of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F or R11), chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2 or R22), trichlorotrifluoroethane (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was a joint venture between DuPont and General Motors.\\n\\n== Use as an aerosol ==\\nThe use of chlorofluorocarbons as aerosols in medicine, such as USP-approved salbutamol, has been phased out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A different propellant known as hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, which was not known to harm the environment, was chosen to replace it.\\n\\n== Retrofitting ==\\nR-12 was used in most refrigeration and vehicle air conditioning applications prior to 1994 before being replaced by 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), which has an insignificant ozone depletion potential. Automobile manufacturers started using R-134a instead of R-12 in 1992–1994. When older units leak or require repair involving removal of the refrigerant, retrofitment to a refrigerant other than R-12 (most commonly R-134a) is required in some jurisdictions. The United States does not require automobile owners to retrofit their systems; however, taxes on ozone-depleting chemicals coupled with the relative scarcity of the original refrigerants on the open market make retrofitting the only economical option. Retrofitment requires a system flush and a new filter/dryer or accumulator, and may also involve the installation of new seals and/or hoses made of materials compatible with the refrigerant being installed. Mineral oil used with R-12 is not compatible with R-134a. Some oils designed for conversion to R-134a are advertised as compatible with residual R-12 mineral oil. Another replacement for R-12 is the highly flammable, but truly drop-in HC-12a, whose flammability has led to injuries and deaths in a bus fire in 2006.\\n\\n== Dangers ==\\nAside from its environmental impacts, R12, like most chlorofluoroalkanes, forms phosgene gas when exposed to a naked flame.\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n== External links ==\\nNOAA/ESRL CFC-12 global measurements\\nInternational Chemical Safety Card 0048\\nOverview of Freon-12 and some of its environmental problems\\nMSDS at Oxford University\\nThermochemistry data at chemnet.ru\\nIR absorption spectra\\nCDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards"\n}', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1549, 'prompt_tokens': 7249, 'total_tokens': 8798}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f0cc76ed-62d4-4f23-89e3-1fec4d388a65-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7249, 'output_tokens': 1549, 'total_tokens': 8798})

They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity gases or liquids which have generally been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. These include chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, both of which cause ozone depletion (although the latter much less so) and contribute to global warming. \'Freon\' is the brand name for the refrigerants R-12, R-13B1, R-22, R-410A, R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company, and so is not used to label all refrigerants of this type. They emit a strong smell similar to acetone. Freon has been found to cause damage to human health when inhaled in large amounts. Studies have been conducted in the pursuit to find beneficial reuses for gases under the Freon umbrella as an alternative to disposal of the gas.\\n\\nIn 1930, General Motors and DuPont formed Kinetic Chemicals to produce Freon. Their product was dichlorodifluoromethane and is now designated \'Freon-12\', \'R-12\', or \'CFC-12\'. The number after the R is a refrigerant class number developed by DuPont to systematically identify single halogenated hydrocarbons, as well as other refrigerants besides halocarbons.\\n\\nMost uses of CFCs are now banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987, as they have been shown to be responsible for ozone depletion.

In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides.

Kettering, vice president of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F or R11), chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2 or R22), trichlorotrifluoroethane (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was a joint venture between DuPont and General Motors.\n\n== Use as an aerosol ==\nThe use of chlorofluorocarbons as aerosols in medicine, such as USP-approved salbutamol, has been phased out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A different propellant known as hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, which was not known to harm the environment, was chosen to replace it.\n\n== Retrofitting ==\nR-12 was used in most refrigeration and vehicle air conditioning applications prior to 1994 before being replaced by 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), which has an insignificant ozone depletion potential. Automobile manufacturers started using R-134a instead of R-12 in 1992–1994. When older units leak or require repair involving removal of the refrigerant, retrofitment to a refrigerant other than R-12 (most commonly R-134a) is required in some jurisdictions. The United States does not require automobile owners to retrofit their systems; however, taxes on ozone-depleting chemicals coupled with the relative scarcity of the original refrigerants on the open market make retrofitting the only economical option. Retrofitment requires a system flush and a new filter/dryer or accumulator, and may also involve the installation of new seals and/or hoses made of materials compatible with the refrigerant being installed. Mineral oil used with R-12 is not compatible with R-134a. Some oils designed for conversion to R-134a are advertised as compatible with residual R-12 mineral oil. Another replacement for R-12 is the highly flammable, but truly drop-in HC-12a, whose flammability has led to injuries and deaths in a bus fire in 2006.\n\n== Dangers ==\nAside from its environmental impacts, R12, like most chlorofluoroalkanes, forms phosgene gas when exposed to a naked flame.\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== References ==\n\n== External links ==\nNOAA/ESRL CFC-12 global measurements\nInternational Chemical Safety Card 0048\nOverview of Freon-12 and some of its environmental problems\nMSDS at Oxford University\nThermochemistry data at chemnet.ru\nIR absorption spectra\nCDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards', 'Freon': "Freon (FREE-on) is a registered trademark of the Chemours Company and generic descriptor for a number of halocarbon products. They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity gases or liquids which have generally been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. These include chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, both of which cause ozone depletion (although the latter much less so) and contribute to global warming. 'Freon' is the brand name for the refrigerants R-12, R-13B1, R-22, R-410A, R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company, and so is not used to label all refrigerants of this type. They emit a strong smell similar to acetone. Freon has been found to cause damage to human health when inhaled in large amounts. Studies have been conducted in the pursuit to find beneficial reuses for gases under the Freon umbrella as an alternative to disposal of the gas.\n\nIn 1930, General Motors and DuPont formed Kinetic Chemicals to produce Freon. Their product was dichlorodifluoromethane and is now designated 'Freon-12', 'R-12', or 'CFC-12'. The number after the R is a refrigerant class number developed by DuPont to systematically identify single halogenated hydrocarbons, as well as other refrigerants besides halocarbons.\n\nMost uses of CFCs are now banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987, as they have been shown to be responsible for ozone depletion. Brands of Freon containing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) instead have replaced many uses, but they, too, are under strict control under the Kyoto Protocol, as they are deemed 'super-greenhouse effect' gases.\n\nDichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or CFC-12), the most commonly used Freon brand refrigerant prior to its ban in many countries in 1996 and total ban in 2010.", 'Chlorofluorocarbon': 'Dichlorodifluoromethane, commonly known as Freon-12, has the formula CCl2F2. It is a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and was widely used as a refrigerant. The boiling point of Freon-12 is −29.8 °C. Freon-12 is also known as R-12 or CFC-12. The physical properties of CFCs, including Freon-12, are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the halogen atoms. In general, they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the halides, which induces intermolecular interactions. The densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes. In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides. Freon-12 is far less flammable than methane, in part because it contains fewer C-H bonds and in part because, in the case of the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames. Freon-12 has been replaced by other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) including R-410A, R-134a, and R-1234yf.'}

They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity gases or liquids which have generally been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. These include chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, both of which cause ozone depletion (although the latter much less so) and contribute to global warming. \'Freon\' is the brand name for the refrigerants R-12, R-13B1, R-22, R-410A, R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company, and so is not used to label all refrigerants of this type.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

Bills H.2943/S.1588) is a container-deposit legislation dealing with recycling in the United States that originally passed in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1982 as the Beverage Container Recovery Law. Implemented in 1983, the law requires containers of carbonated beverages to be returnable with a minimum return value of $0.05. The bottle bill does not cover containers of non-carbonated beverages like water, tea, or sports drinks.

Listed on containers as 'California Redemption Value' or 'CRV.'\n* Connecticut: 5¢. Applies to beer, carbonated soft drinks, and non-carbonated beverages.\n* Hawaii: 5¢. In addition, Hawaii charges a nonrefundable 1¢ fee per container to fund the program.\n* Iowa: 5¢ for containers that held carbonated beverages.\n* Maine: 5¢ on fruit juice, soda, beer, and bottled water; 15¢ for most liquor and wine cans/bottles.\n* Massachusetts: 5¢ for containers that held carbonated beverages.\n* Michigan: 10¢ for both non-refillable and refillable containers.\n* New York: 5¢ for containers under one gallon that held carbonated beverages or water.\n* Oregon: 10¢ for most beverage containers.\n* Vermont: 5¢ for most containers; 15¢ for most liquor bottles.\n\nIn Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, and Massachusetts, unclaimed deposits are deemed abandoned by the public and are therefore property of the state. In California and Hawaii, uncollected deposits are used to cover the administrative costs of the deposit program. In Iowa and Oregon, the beverage distribution industry keeps the unredeemed deposits.", 'Massachusetts Bottle Bill': "The Massachusetts Bottle Bill (Mass. Bills H.2943/S.1588) is a container-deposit legislation dealing with recycling in the United States that originally passed in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1982 as the Beverage Container Recovery Law. Implemented in 1983, the law requires containers of carbonated beverages to be returnable with a minimum return value of $0.05. The bottle bill does not cover containers of non-carbonated beverages like water, tea, or sports drinks. The law also establishes the handling fee paid by distributors to redemption centers, $0.0325 per unit as of July 5, 2013, and to retailers $0.0225 per unit. As the number of non-deposit beverage containers (water, tea, sports beverages, etc.) has increased to represent over one-third of beverage containers sold, the Bottle Bill has no influence on these non-deposit containers, with the result that these containers are three times more likely to be found as litter in Massachusetts communities.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.

{
  "initial_query": "Calculate the total cost after a 20% discount on a $100 item.",
  "partial_solution": "'costs': 100, 'discount_percentage': 20"
}
Output: true
Explanation: The partial solution identifies the discount percentage but does not calculate the discounted amount.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "What is the area of a triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm?",
  "partial_solution": "'base': 5, 'height': 10"

Explanation: The partial solution provides the necessary dimensions but does not calculate the area.
</example_2>

<example_3>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "How many people lived in Switzerland in 2022?",
  "partial_solution": "population: 8,766 million"
}
Output: false
Explanation: The partial solution already contains that the population of Switzerland in 2022 was of 8,766 million people.
</example_3>

<example_3>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "What is the probability of rolling at two six with two six-sided dice?",

Given the initial problem: It's May 2023, and I'm about to drive across the U.S. from California to Maine. I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

<examples>
<examples>
<example_1>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "Calculate the total cost after a 20% discount on a $100 item.",
  "partial_solution": "'costs': 100, 'discount_percentage': 20"
}
Output: true
Explanation: The partial solution identifies the discount percentage but does not calculate the discounted amount.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "What is the area of a triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm?",
  "partial_solution": "'base': 5, 'height': 10"
}
Output: true
Explanation: The partial solution provides the necessary dimensions but does not calculate the area.
</example_2>

<example_3>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "How many people lived in Switzerland in 2022?",
  "partial_solution": "population: 8,766 million"
}
Output: false
Explanation: The partial solution already contains that the population of Switzerland in 2022 was of 8,766 million people.
</example_3>

<example_3>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "What is the probability of rolling at two six with two six-sided dice?",
  "partial_solution": "We roll two six-sided dice. There are 36 possible outcomes. and only one is made by two six"
}
Output: false
Explanation: The partial solution already contains that the probability is 1/36.
</example_3>

<example_4>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "List the steps to set up a new email account.",
  "partial_solution": "Go to the website, click on 'Create an account', fill out the form, and submit."
}
Output: false
Explanation: The task is procedural and does not require mathematical calculations.
</example_4>

<example_5>
Input:
{
  "initial_query": "Explain the causes of World War I.",
  "partial_solution": "World War I was caused by ..."
}
Output: false
Explanation: The query is historical and explanatory, with no need for mathematical calculations.
</example_5>

You are a formatter and extractor. Your task is to combine partial solution from a database and format them according to the initial problem statement.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Understand the initial problem, the problem nuances, the desired output, and the desired output format.
2. Review the provided partial solution.
3. Integrate and elaborate on the various pieces of information from the partial solution to produce a complete solution to the initial problem. Do not invent any new information.
4. Format the complete solution according to the desired output specified in the initial problem. Pay extra attention to any required format nuances. Ensure the solution is clear and concise. Do not add any more information than required.
5. Remove any additional comments surrounding the final answer unless required by the problem. Be as concise as possible.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```

<example_1>
Initial problem: What are the preferred ice cream flavors in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.
</example_1>
<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Given partial solution:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

Solution: 68
Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000

Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

<example_1>
Initial problem: What are the preferred ice cream flavors in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.
</example_1>
<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Given partial solution:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

Solution: 68
Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000

Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>

The total distance from Los Angeles to Augusta via I-40 and I-90 is approximately 3,000 miles. I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles, which means I will drink 150 bottles (3,000 miles / 100 miles * 5 bottles). The states with bottle deposits along the route are California (0.05 USD per bottle), Ohio (0.05 USD per bottle), Massachusetts (0.05 USD per bottle), and New York (0.05 USD per bottle). Therefore, the total amount I will get back is 150 bottles * 0.05 USD = 7.50 USD.

Each client has ordered a new awning for the back of their house within the last 90 days. The company makes different designs depending on whether the awning is made to block sunrises or sunsets. In this region, houses with odd-numbered street addresses face east, and houses with even-numbered street addresses face west. How many of these clients will be receiving the sunset awning design?

The company makes different designs depending on whether the awning is made to block sunrises or sunsets. In this region, houses with odd-numbered street addresses face east, and houses with even-numbered street addresses face west. How many of these clients will be receiving the sunset awning design?

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.

<task>
You are a linguistic expert and a skilled problem solver. Your role is to select the best final solution from a list of options based on an initial problem and a partial solution provided.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the initial problem, its nuances, and the desired output format.
2. Review the partial solutions and the list of final formatted solutions.
3. Choose the most appropriate final solution.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

<examples>
<example_1>
Initial problem: What is the preferred ice cream flavor in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

List of final solutions:
solution 1: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 2: Strawberry, Cream, Chocolate, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 3: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio

Reasoning:
The correct solution is "Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio" because it aligns with the requirement to list flavors from most to least common, resolving ties alphabetically. While solution 2 is not alphabetically sorted.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Partial solutions:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

List of final solutions: 
solution 1: 50
solution 2: 100
solution 3: 68

Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000
Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>

2. **Paladins** - They use holy magic extensively, especially in their Holy specialization, which is focused on healing. Their other specializations, Protection and Retribution, also use holy spells to some extent.

These classes utilize holy magic for healing, protection, and offensive purposes, depending on their specialization and role within the game.

Characters can learn all three secondary skills: archeology, cooking, and fishing. Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild\'s chat channel, the guild name and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues. Much of World of Warcraft play involves the completion of quests. These quests are usually available from NPCs. Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, as well as the ability to explore new areas. It is through quests that much of the game\'s story is told, both through the quest\'s text and through scripted NPC actions. Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures. While a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. World of Warcraft uses a \\"rested bonus\\" system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game. When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or wisp for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard. Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character\'s body is unreachable, they can use a special \\"spirit healer\\" NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called \\"resurrection sickness\\" for up to ten minutes, depending on the character\'s level. This \\"resurrection sickness\\" does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items. World of Warcraft contains a variety of mechanisms for player versus player (PvP) play. Players on player versus environment (PvE) servers can opt to toggle \\"War Mode\\" themselves, making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction. Depending on the mode of the realm, PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world—the only exception being the starting zones, where the PvP \\"flag\\" must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction. PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players. Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game.

The game has three roles, DPS (damage dealer), tank and healer; a member of any class can be customized for the DPS role, while members of some classes, known as hybrids, can also be customized as healers, tanks or any of the three roles. Currently available classes are: druids, death knight, demon hunters, hunters, mages, monks, paladins, priests, rogues, shamans, warlocks and warriors. Originally, paladins were available only to Alliance races and shamans were only available to Horde races, but both classes were made available to both sides in The Burning Crusade. The death knight, introduced in Wrath of the Lich King, is a hero class, with the characters beginning at level 55 (roughly mid-way to a maximum level), already equipped with powerful gear. Creation of a death knight required the player to already have at least one level 55 character on their account, since Legion this is no longer the case. The demon hunter, introduced in Legion, is another hero class that requires the player to have a level 70 character. Once a player has one, the player is permitted to create a demon hunter that starts at level 98.\n\nWhile a character can be played on its own, players can also group up with others in order to tackle more challenging content.

The mechanics of each class vary, with some geared towards melee combat, while others are more suited to attacking from range or casting spells. The game has three roles, DPS (damage dealer), tank and healer; a member of any class can be customized for the DPS role, while members of some classes, known as hybrids, can also be customized as healers, tanks or any of the three roles. Currently available classes are: druids, death knight, demon hunters, hunters, mages, monks, paladins, priests, rogues, shamans, warlocks and warriors. Originally, paladins were available only to Alliance races and shamans were only available to Horde races, but both classes were made available to both sides in The Burning Crusade. The death knight, introduced in Wrath of the Lich King, is a hero class, with the characters beginning at level 55 (roughly mid-way to a maximum level), already equipped with powerful gear. Creation of a death knight required the player to already have at least one level 55 character on their account, since Legion this is no longer the case. The demon hunter, introduced in Legion, is another hero class that requires the player to have a level 70 character. Once a player has one, the player is permitted to create a demon hunter that starts at level 98.\\n\\nWhile a character can be played on its own, players can also group up with others in order to tackle more challenging content. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. Players are also able to customize their character through the use of talents, which are further abilities related to their character class.\\n\\nCharacters are also able to learn two primary professions from ten options. These can be gathering professions, such as mining, herbalism or animal skinning. Characters can also choose from gear crafting professions, such as blacksmithing or leatherworking, or item enhancement professions such as enchanting or jewelcrafting. Professions are not directly linked to a character\'s class (e.g., warriors can be alchemists, mages can be skinners, etc.). However, some skills available to certain classes (e.g., the ability to track animals) are useful to certain professions. Characters can also learn all secondary professions: cooking, fishing, first aid and archaeology. In the Burning Crusade expansion, additional profession specialisations were added, allowing a character to gain new restricted techniques such as an alchemist mastering potions, elixirs, or transmutations. In the Cataclysm expansion, the secondary profession of archaeology was added which allows players to dig up and recover artifacts from all over the game.\\n\\nAs well as banding together to form groups, players can also band together to form a guild. These organizations allow players several benefits, such as easier communication through a shared chat channel and an identifying guild name and tabard. Guild members can also be given access to a central pool of resources known as a guild bank. Guilds can also make use of an in-game calendar, allowing guild members to view scheduled events, and respond to them with whether they can attend or not. This calendar can also be accessed without need to log into the game, using the Armory feature. Guild members that accomplish goals together gain guild experience and advance the level of their guild, granting guild members various benefits."\n}\n```', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 726, 'prompt_tokens': 6370, 'total_tokens': 7096}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-96bc71c9-800a-4336-b65b-f2b10df39c76-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6370, 'output_tokens': 726, 'total_tokens': 7096})

Characters from the opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication, but only members of the same faction can speak, mail, group, and join guilds. The player selects the new character\'s race, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves for the Alliance. Players must select the class for the character, with choices such as mages, warriors, and priests available. Most classes are limited to particular races.\\n\\nAs characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character. Characters can choose two primary professions that can focus on producing items, such as tailoring, blacksmithing, or jewelcrafting, or on gathering from resource nodes, such as skinning or mining. Characters can learn all three secondary skills: archeology, cooking, and fishing. Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild\'s chat channel, the guild name, and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft contains a variety of mechanisms for player versus player (PvP) play. Players on player versus environment (PvE) servers can opt to toggle \'War Mode\' themselves, making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction. Depending on the mode of the realm, PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world—the only exception being the starting zones, where the PvP \'flag\' must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction. PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players. Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game. Winning a battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing. In addition, players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground.\\n\\nThe game allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons, and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat; however, the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily focuses on character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire better equipment, among other game systems.\\n\\nAs characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character.

These quests are usually available from NPCs. Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, as well as the ability to explore new areas. It is through quests that much of the game\'s story is told, both through the quest\'s text and through scripted NPC actions. Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures.\\n\\nWhile a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. World of Warcraft uses a \'rested bonus\' system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game. When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or wisp for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard. Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character\'s body is unreachable, they can use a special \'spirit healer\' NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called \'resurrection sickness\' for up to ten minutes, depending on the character\'s level. This \'resurrection sickness\' does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items."\n}', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1294, 'prompt_tokens': 13878, 'total_tokens': 15172}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-fc082099-eb9a-444c-b676-2212e1d06600-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13878, 'output_tokens': 1294, 'total_tokens': 15172})

An 11th character slot was added on the release of Monks, allowing a player to have one of each class on the same server. In the Legion expansion, Mistweaver monks lost the Chi resource and the Fistweaving talent that allowed them to heal by dealing damage. This converted Mistweaver monks into a standard healing class that directly heals allies through the use of a mana resource bar.\\n\\nPandaren race: The classes available to pandaren characters are Hunter, Monk, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warrior, and Death Knight."\n}', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 287, 'prompt_tokens': 5584, 'total_tokens': 5871}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-7bdfd265-1d8c-4cf4-b56c-537449bb20be-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5584, 'output_tokens': 287, 'total_tokens': 5871})
2024-09-01 23:14:51,724 — Controller — INFO — _invoke_tools_after_llm_response:401 — Tool 'wikipedia_search' output: {'Gameplay of World of Warcraft': "Depending on the race chosen and the expansions installed, a player then has five to eight of the game's thirteen character classes to choose from. The mechanics of each class vary, with some geared towards melee combat, while others are more suited to attacking from range or casting spells. The game has three roles, DPS (damage dealer), tank and healer; a member of any class can be customized for the DPS role, while members of some classes, known as hybrids, can also be customized as healers, tanks or any of the three roles. Currently available classes are: druids, death knight, demon hunters, hunters, mages, monks, paladins, priests, rogues, shamans, warlocks and warriors. Originally, paladins were available only to Alliance races and shamans were only available to Horde races, but both classes were made available to both sides in The Burning Crusade. The death knight, introduced in Wrath of the Lich King, is a hero class, with the characters beginning at level 55 (roughly mid-way to a maximum level), already equipped with powerful gear. Creation of a death knight required the player to already have at least one level 55 character on their account, since Legion this is no longer the case. The demon hunter, introduced in Legion, is another hero class that requires the player to have a level 70 character. Once a player has one, the player is permitted to create a demon hunter that starts at level 98.\n\nWhile a character can be played on its own, players can also group up with others in order to tackle more challenging content. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. Players are also able to customize their character through the use of talents, which are further abilities related to their character class.\n\nCharacters are also able to learn two primary professions from ten options. These can be gathering professions, such as mining, herbalism or animal skinning. Characters can also choose from gear crafting professions, such as blacksmithing or leatherworking, or item enhancement professions such as enchanting or jewelcrafting. Professions are not directly linked to a character's class (e.g., warriors can be alchemists, mages can be skinners, etc.). However, some skills available to certain classes (e.g., the ability to track animals) are useful to certain professions. Characters can also learn all secondary professions: cooking, fishing, first aid and archaeology. In the Burning Crusade expansion, additional profession specialisations were added, allowing a character to gain new restricted techniques such as an alchemist mastering potions, elixirs, or transmutations. In the Cataclysm expansion, the secondary profession of archaeology was added which allows players to dig up and recover artifacts from all over the game.\n\nAs well as banding together to form groups, players can also band together to form a guild. These organizations allow players several benefits, such as easier communication through a shared chat channel and an identifying guild name and tabard. Guild members can also be given access to a central pool of resources known as a guild bank. Guilds can also make use of an in-game calendar, allowing guild members to view scheduled events, and respond to them with whether they can attend or not. This calendar can also be accessed without need to log into the game, using the Armory feature. Guild members that accomplish goals together gain guild experience and advance the level of their guild, granting guild members various benefits.", 'World of Warcraft': "To create a new character, players must choose between the opposing factions of the Alliance or the Horde. Characters from the opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication, but only members of the same faction can speak, mail, group, and join guilds. The player selects the new character's race, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves for the Alliance. Players must select the class for the character, with choices such as mages, warriors, and priests available. Most classes are limited to particular races.\n\nAs characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character. Characters can choose two primary professions that can focus on producing items, such as tailoring, blacksmithing, or jewelcrafting, or on gathering from resource nodes, such as skinning or mining. Characters can learn all three secondary skills: archeology, cooking, and fishing. Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild's chat channel, the guild name, and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues.\n\nWorld of Warcraft contains a variety of mechanisms for player versus player (PvP) play. Players on player versus environment (PvE) servers can opt to toggle 'War Mode' themselves, making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction. Depending on the mode of the realm, PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world—the only exception being the starting zones, where the PvP 'flag' must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction. PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players. Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game. Winning a battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing. In addition, players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground.\n\nThe game allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons, and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat; however, the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily focuses on character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire better equipment, among other game systems.\n\nAs characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character.

Characters may form and join guilds, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild's chat channel, the guild name, and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues.\n\nMuch of World of Warcraft play involves the completion of quests. These quests are usually available from NPCs. Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, as well as the ability to explore new areas. It is through quests that much of the game's story is told, both through the quest's text and through scripted NPC actions. Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a quest chain. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures.\n\nWhile a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group. World of Warcraft uses a 'rested bonus' system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game. When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or wisp for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard. Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character's body is unreachable, they can use a special 'spirit healer' NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called 'resurrection sickness' for up to ten minutes, depending on the character's level. This 'resurrection sickness' does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items.", 'World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria': "Monk class: Monks use an energy source to power basic abilities like Jab. The basic Jab attack is used to generate a resource called 'Chi', which are then used for more advanced attacks. The monk class has three specializations: Brewmaster (tanking), Windwalker (melee damage), and Mistweaver (healing). Monks' healing specialization is capable of healing allies through dealing damage to enemies, as well as through 'proximity' based heals, and by dropping statues, similar to a shaman totem, that pulse healing as they perform attacks on the enemy target.

A 5-man group made up of one tank, one healer, and three DPS is doing a dungeon that was just released in World of Warcraft. Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?

This season, filmed in May and June 2019, is the eighth consecutive season to be filmed in Fiji. Celebrating the show\'s twentieth anniversary milestone, the season featured twenty returning winners from past Survivor seasons competing for a US$2 million prize. It was won by Tony Vlachos by a 12–4–0 vote over Natalie Anderson and Michele Fitzgerald, becoming the second two-time winner in Survivor. The season aired on CBS in the United States from February 12, 2020, to May 13, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the usual live finale for the winner reveal was replaced by a live teleconference between host Jeff Probst, situated in his garage, and the finalists in their respective homes.\\nThis season is the thirteenth season to feature returning players, and the fifth season to feature only returning players. In addition, the season brought back the Edge of Extinction twist first introduced in the show\'s thirty-eighth season, where voted-out players could opt to stay for a chance to return into the game. The season introduced fire tokens, a form of currency that could be used by remaining players in the game to buy rewards or advantages. This was also the most recent season to be played over 39 days.\\nThe season was preceded by a retrospective special titled Survivor at 40: Greatest Moments and Players on February 5, 2020, which featured interviews with past players, series highlights and first few minutes of the premiere episode. Winners at War received mixed reviews from critics and fans; commentators praised the season\'s cast, strategy and memorable moments, but criticized the Edge of Extinction and the editing. The new Fire Tokens twist also received mixed reviews.\\n\\n== Production ==\\nThe season\'s theme and players were announced at the finale of Survivor: Island of the Idols on December 18, 2019, revealing that the season would consist of 20 winners from past Survivor seasons. The winner would receive $2,000,000, the largest cash prize ever given out in American reality TV history since The X Factor.\\nIn addition to the larger grand prize, the payouts for all contestants were increased for this season only: whereas in previous seasons the first contestant eliminated received US$2,500 with increasing payouts for subsequently eliminated contestants, each returning player in Winners at War was guaranteed a minimum US$25,000 payment for participating in the season.\\nDue to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the typical live reunion show following the two-hour finale episode did not take place, but instead, the finale ran for three hours, with the final segments featuring Probst remotely from his home garage to video chatting, in a small makeshift set with the final three to announce the winner. All 20 contestants also appeared on screen together at the beginning of the finale from their homes.\\n\\n== Casting ==\\nWhen asked about the possibility of an all-winners season during a 2018 interview with Us Weekly, host and executive producer Jeff Probst stated that it was unlikely, saying, \\"we have 10 great winners that you\'d want to see play again. We don\'t have 20. We don\'t have 18. Some of the winners don\'t want to play again. Some of the greats are like, \'No, we\'re done.\'\\" In 2019, CBS president Kelly Kahl, who had been a proponent of Survivor since its beginning, suggested the idea again to Probst as a way to celebrate the show\'s 20th anniversary, and nearly all of the previous winners that were asked accepted the offers to return. Among those who accepted who the production team had considered unlikely to return were married couple Rob and Amber Mariano, who had begun their relationship while competing on Survivor: All-Stars, and Survivor: Micronesia winner Parvati Shallow, who had initially declined the offer as she had recently given birth. Probst has cited those three accepting the offers as the impetus to move forward with the season.\\nAmong those that did not return included John Cochran, winner of Survivor: Caramoan, whom Jeff Probst called \\"the only one that would have been on the list [where] if he had said yes would probably have a spot on the show\\" in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. Richard Hatch, winner of the show\'s first season, Survivor: Borneo, was not included due to his behavior in Survivor: All-Stars in which he competed in a challenge naked and his genitals made incidental contact with another contestant, Susan Hawk, who quit the game shortly thereafter. \\"Given his history on our show, it did not seem appropriate\\", said Probst to Us Weekly. \\"We were in a different time and different culture back then and we would never let him run a challenge naked now.\\" In that same interview, Probst revealed that Survivor: Palau winner Tom Westman was among the castaways who was ultimately cut. According to Inside Survivor both Tina Wesson, winner of Survivor: The Australian Outback, and Mike Holloway, winner of Survivor: Worlds Apart, were included in the mix for casting but cut along the way. Additionally, Survivor: Fiji winner Earl Cole was contacted, but declined due to the birth of his child. Survivor: Panama winner Aras Baskauskas was also contacted but declined, feeling unwilling to leave his children. Survivor: China winner Todd Herzog confirmed on the Talking with T-Bird podcast that he was contacted and considered, but ultimately cut. Survivor: Gabon winner Bob Crowley was not contacted to compete. Survivor: Marquesas winner Vecepia Towery confirmed on the Talking with T-Bird podcast that she was not contacted to compete. Survivor: Edge of Extinction winner Chris Underwood was asked to return, but he declined when he received the call just 12 hours after getting married. Survivor: Thailand winner Brian Heidik was not contacted to compete. Survivor: The Amazon winner Jenna Morasca confirmed on the Talking with T-Bird podcast that she was not contacted to compete. Survivor: Nicaragua winner Jud \\"Fabio\\" Birza was not contacted to compete.\\nWhile Denise Stapley was the oldest player to play the game, her age of 48 was much lower than many other seasons\' oldest players. Nonetheless, the average age of the players for this season is the highest of any other prior season at 37.85 years, beating out Survivor: Nicaragua\'s average age of 37.6 years, and much higher than the average ages of players from several of the past recent seasons which have skewed younger. Probst said they did not even consider the age of the players when asking the winners to return, though did feel that older players are more interesting to watch, as their maturity brings unique facets to the game.\\n\\n== Game format ==\\nAll but two of the challenges during the season were based on previous challenges that at least one of the winners had participated in. While this had been done before in Survivor: All-Stars, Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, Survivor: Cambodia and Survivor: Game Changers, Probst stated that they would not draw attention to who had done previous challenges unless there had been a major event involving it from a prior season.\\nThis season reintroduced the Edge of Extinction from Survivor: Edge of Extinction, the show\'s thirty-eighth season, wherein contestants who are voted out are taken to a desolate, abandoned beach with fewer amenities than the tribe camps. Contestants on the Edge of Extinction may either wait for an opportunity to rejoin the main game by winning a competition or may choose to leave the game at any point by raising a white sail. Unlike in Survivor: Edge of Extinction, Winners at War contestants were not given the option to decline heading to the Edge of Extinction, though they could raise the mast immediately upon arrival. While the Edge of Extinction had been controversial with fans when it was first used, the element was added for this season as an assurance to returning players of additional chances to get back into the game after being voted out, a concern that had been raised by some when Probst spoke to them about returning.\\nThis season introduced \\"fire tokens\\", a currency that allows players to purchase comfort items, food, and advantages. Probst said that the producers had come up with the idea of fire tokens to emphasize that the game is about creating a society, and these tokens could help in establishing that society. Each player started the game with one token, but could give tokens to other players at any time. When voted out, players must bequeath all of their tokens to remaining players before heading to the Edge of Extinction. Players on the Edge of Extinction were given the chance to win fire tokens by either finding advantages and privately selling them to remaining players, or by completing tasks; the players could then use the tokens at the Edge of Extinction to buy comfort items, food or advantages, including advantages for the eventual challenge to return to the main game.\\n\\n== Contestants ==\\n\\n20 previous winners competed on this season of Survivor.\\n\\n\\n=== Future appearances ===\\nSandra Diaz-Twine subsequently competed on Australian Survivor: Blood V Water with her daughter, Nina Twine.\\nOutside of Survivor, Natalie Anderson competed on the thirty-sixth season of MTV\'s The Challenge. Wendell Holland competed on the discovery+ special Beach Cabana Royale. Michele Fitzgerald competed on the thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth, and thirty-ninth seasons of The Challenge, and also on the second season of The Challenge: USA. In 2022, Ben Driebergen, Sarah Lacina and Tyson Apostol competed on the first season of The Challenge: USA. That same year, Kwon was a contestant on the USA Network reality competition series, Snake in the Grass. In 2023, Driebergen and Lacina competed on The Challenge: World Championship. In 2024, Diaz-Twine and Parvati Shallow competed on the second season of the Peacock reality TV series The Traitors. Rob Mariano joined NBC\'s new spin-off, Deal or No Deal Island, as a contestant.\\n\\n== Season summary ==\\nTwenty former winners were divided into two tribes of ten: Sele and Dakal. Players with heavy connections outside of the game were targeted first, including Natalie (aligned with Jeremy) and Amber (married to Rob). The “old-school” players fared poorly early on; even after a tribe swap, every winner from the first half of Survivor\'s season history was eliminated before the merge. They were all sent to the Edge of Extinction to compete in challenges for the chance to earn fire tokens and sell advantages to players still in the game. The lone exception was Sandra, who raised the white flag and declined to remain on the Edge for a chance to earn her way back into the game.\\nOn Day 19, Tyson rejoined the game in the first battle-back challenge and the tribes merged. Tyson joined players like Tony, Jeremy, and Ben in an effort to keep the big targets (the “lions”) together to eliminate the more under-the-radar players (the “hyenas”). Tony felt threatened by Sarah and Sophie\'s growing connection, fearing that Sophie and Sarah would become a power duo. Tony led the charge of Sophie\'s blindside. However, the alliance of Tony and Sarah (self-dubbed “Cops R’ Us”) reconciled, and with free agents Ben and Nick controlled the majority of the votes post-merge, with Nick getting blindsided before the Edge of Extinction competition.\\nOn Day 35, Natalie rejoined the game in the second battle-back challenge and found herself and Michele on the outside of a foursome including Tony, Sarah, Ben, and Denise. Natalie managed to survive thanks to two idol plays and a final immunity win, assisting in voting out Denise and Ben and forcing Tony to eliminate Sarah in an emotional firemaking challenge.\\nAt the Final Tribal Council, most of the jurors had positive things to say to all three of them. Natalie was praised for her dominant Edge of Extinction gameplay, using multiple advantages and social connections to further herself in the game. Michele was praised for being an underdog, having many relaxed social connections with the jurors, and winning two immunity challenges when she needed to save herself. Tony was praised for being in Cops R Us with Sarah, having personal connections with multiple people, orchestrating multiple blindsides, and winning 4 immunity challenges. Even though Jeremy was mad at Tony for directly blindsiding too many people, Tony was awarded the title of Sole Survivor in a 12–4–0 vote over Natalie and Michele.\\n\\n== Episodes ==\\n\\n== Voting history ==\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\nWinners at War received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised the all-winners cast, gameplay and memorable moments but criticized the return of the Edge of Extinction twist, the early exit of some fan favorite players and the editing. The season\'s all-stars cast was amongst the chief aspects to have been widely praised by television critics. Commentators variously described Tony Vlachos as the \\"most entertaining\\" and Michele Fitzgerald as \\"one of the best social players in the history of the game\\". Fitzgerald\'s jury speech drew much attention and has been widely praised; while former contestant Richard Hatch felt that \\"everything came together\\" for Fitzgerald in the final speech, Katie Baker of The Ringer highlighted her ability to encapsulate her journey as \\"excellent\\". Such former players as Andrea Boehlke, Peih-Gee Law, and David Wright were especially appreciative of her social game and underdog story in an Entertainment Weekly roundtable previewing the finale. Others including Cirie Fields, Eliza Orlins and Jonathan Penner favoured Vlachos\' dominant game. Orlins summarised Vlachos saying \\"he has not had a single vote cast against him, [has placated] even those he has not voted with [and] won multiple individual challenges.\\"\\nOther than the two finalists, players including Sarah Lacina, Denise Stapley, Kim Spradlin-Wolfe, and Sophie Clarke were also noted for their strong performances. Collectively, the six contestants won 10 of the 13 Player of the Week awards (three each for Vlachos and Fitzgerald, two for Clarke) in fan polls on the website Inside Survivor. Clarke, who was vocal about feeling like a \\"bottom-tier winner\\" coming into season, grew increasingly popular during the pre-merge game and was noted for her role in blindsiding the likes of Rob Mariano and Wendell Holland. Several commentators praised her understated style of play and puzzle-solving skills. Writing for Vulture, Martin Holmes called her \\"a force this season, corralling the numbers, finding idols, and taking charge when necessary\\".\\nHolmes gave a positive review of Winners at War. While he stated that it \\"hasn\'t been a perfect season\\" due to the Edge of Extinction remaining \\"a flawed twist\\", all old-school players being voted out early, and the editing, he praised the season\'s humor, emotional moments, the final three, and the eventual winner. Reviewing the finale, he highlighted Vlachos\' \\"high-wire trickery, master manipulation, and control of the votes\\" and Fitzgerald\'s \\"scrappy, socially adept, but under the radar\\" game. Holmes would later rank this season 13th out of 40. Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly gave the finale a positive review, calling Vlachos a highly entertaining player: \\"no one else mixes game sense and nonsense more than him\\". He also praised Fitzgerald\'s tenacious game, survival instinct, and final jury speech, saying that \\"it’s pretty impossible not to be happy for her\\". Dalton would ultimately rank Winners at War as the 9th best Survivor season. In 2021, Rob Has a Podcast ranked Winners at War 7th during their Survivor All-Time Top 40 Rankings podcast.\\nHolmes was critical of the \\"nightmarish\\" Edge of Extinction twist; he said: \\"under normal circumstances, I’d have been rooting for [Natalie Anderson]. But it demonstrates the inherent flaw in the Edge. It punishes those who make it far while rewarding those voted out earlier.\\" Ross also criticized the return of the Edge of Extinction, stating \\"This isn’t even about fairness or anything like that — although Nick lasting all the way to day 34 and having zero opportunities to earn a single token before the competition certainly is anything but fair — but more about what makes for a more dramatic and intriguing contest.\\"\\nAt the conclusion of the season, the three finalists were added to The Ringer\'s Hall of Fame of Survivor players, which already consisted of fellow Winners at War contestants Mariano, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Parvati Shallow. For their performances over the course of multiple seasons, Lacina and Spradlin-Wolfe were also added to the list, as were Jeremy Collins, Tyson Apostol, Ethan Zohn, and Yul Kwon.\\n\\n\\n=== Viewing figures ===\\n\\n\\n==== United States ====\\n\\n\\n==== Canada ====\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial CBS Survivor Website"\n}\n```', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3553, 'prompt_tokens': 75236, 'total_tokens': 78789}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-a24d93c1-ed73-4707-a7c7-4d09ff601aa8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 75236, 'output_tokens': 3553, 'total_tokens': 78789})

This season, filmed in May and June 2019, is the eighth consecutive season to be filmed in Fiji. Celebrating the show\'s twentieth anniversary milestone, the season featured twenty returning winners from past Survivor seasons competing for a US$2 million prize. It was won by Tony Vlachos by a 12–4–0 vote over Natalie Anderson and Michele Fitzgerald, becoming the second two-time winner in Survivor. The season aired on CBS in the United States from February 12, 2020, to May 13, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the usual live finale for the winner reveal was replaced by a live teleconference between host Jeff Probst, situated in his garage, and the finalists in their respective homes.\nThis season is the thirteenth season to feature returning players, and the fifth season to feature only returning players. In addition, the season brought back the Edge of Extinction twist first introduced in the show\'s thirty-eighth season, where voted-out players could opt to stay for a chance to return into the game. The season introduced fire tokens, a form of currency that could be used by remaining players in the game to buy rewards or advantages. This was also the most recent season to be played over 39 days.\nThe season was preceded by a retrospective special titled Survivor at 40: Greatest Moments and Players on February 5, 2020, which featured interviews with past players, series highlights and first few minutes of the premiere episode. Winners at War received mixed reviews from critics and fans; commentators praised the season\'s cast, strategy and memorable moments, but criticized the Edge of Extinction and the editing. The new Fire Tokens twist also received mixed reviews.\n\n== Production ==\nThe season\'s theme and players were announced at the finale of Survivor: Island of the Idols on December 18, 2019, revealing that the season would consist of 20 winners from past Survivor seasons. The winner would receive $2,000,000, the largest cash prize ever given out in American reality TV history since The X Factor.\nIn addition to the larger grand prize, the payouts for all contestants were increased for this season only: whereas in previous seasons the first contestant eliminated received US$2,500 with increasing payouts for subsequently eliminated contestants, each returning player in Winners at War was guaranteed a minimum US$25,000 payment for participating in the season.\nDue to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the typical live reunion show following the two-hour finale episode did not take place, but instead, the finale ran for three hours, with the final segments featuring Probst remotely from his home garage to video chatting, in a small makeshift set with the final three to announce the winner. All 20 contestants also appeared on screen together at the beginning of the finale from their homes.\n\n== Casting ==\nWhen asked about the possibility of an all-winners season during a 2018 interview with Us Weekly, host and executive producer Jeff Probst stated that it was unlikely, saying, "we have 10 great winners that you\'d want to see play again.

Among those who accepted who the production team had considered unlikely to return were married couple Rob and Amber Mariano, who had begun their relationship while competing on Survivor: All-Stars, and Survivor: Micronesia winner Parvati Shallow, who had initially declined the offer as she had recently given birth. Probst has cited those three accepting the offers as the impetus to move forward with the season.\nAmong those that did not return included John Cochran, winner of Survivor: Caramoan, whom Jeff Probst called "the only one that would have been on the list [where] if he had said yes would probably have a spot on the show" in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. Richard Hatch, winner of the show\'s first season, Survivor: Borneo, was not included due to his behavior in Survivor: All-Stars in which he competed in a challenge naked and his genitals made incidental contact with another contestant, Susan Hawk, who quit the game shortly thereafter. "Given his history on our show, it did not seem appropriate", said Probst to Us Weekly. "We were in a different time and different culture back then and we would never let him run a challenge naked now." In that same interview, Probst revealed that Survivor: Palau winner Tom Westman was among the castaways who was ultimately cut. According to Inside Survivor both Tina Wesson, winner of Survivor: The Australian Outback, and Mike Holloway, winner of Survivor: Worlds Apart, were included in the mix for casting but cut along the way. Additionally, Survivor: Fiji winner Earl Cole was contacted, but declined due to the birth of his child. Survivor: Panama winner Aras Baskauskas was also contacted but declined, feeling unwilling to leave his children. Survivor: China winner Todd Herzog confirmed on the Talking with T-Bird podcast that he was contacted and considered, but ultimately cut. Survivor: Gabon winner Bob Crowley was not contacted to compete. Survivor: Marquesas winner Vecepia Towery confirmed on the Talking with T-Bird podcast that she was not contacted to compete. Survivor: Edge of Extinction winner Chris Underwood was asked to return, but he declined when he received the call just 12 hours after getting married. Survivor: Thailand winner Brian Heidik was not contacted to compete. Survivor: The Amazon winner Jenna Morasca confirmed on the Talking with T-Bird podcast that she was not contacted to compete. Survivor: Nicaragua winner Jud "Fabio" Birza was not contacted to compete.\nWhile Denise Stapley was the oldest player to play the game, her age of 48 was much lower than many other seasons\' oldest players.

Wendell Holland competed on the discovery+ special Beach Cabana Royale. Michele Fitzgerald competed on the thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth, and thirty-ninth seasons of The Challenge, and also on the second season of The Challenge: USA.

The season\'s all-stars cast was amongst the chief aspects to have been widely praised by television critics. Commentators variously described Tony Vlachos as the "most entertaining" and Michele Fitzgerald as "one of the best social players in the history of the game".

Such former players as Andrea Boehlke, Peih-Gee Law, and David Wright were especially appreciative of her social game and underdog story in an Entertainment Weekly roundtable previewing the finale. Others including Cirie Fields, Eliza Orlins and Jonathan Penner favoured Vlachos\' dominant game. Orlins summarised Vlachos saying "he has not had a single vote cast against him, [has placated] even those he has not voted with [and] won multiple individual challenges."\nOther than the two finalists, players including Sarah Lacina, Denise Stapley, Kim Spradlin-Wolfe, and Sophie Clarke were also noted for their strong performances. Collectively, the six contestants won 10 of the 13 Player of the Week awards (three each for Vlachos and Fitzgerald, two for Clarke) in fan polls on the website Inside Survivor. Clarke, who was vocal about feeling like a "bottom-tier winner" coming into season, grew increasingly popular during the pre-merge game and was noted for her role in blindsiding the likes of Rob Mariano and Wendell Holland.

In 2021, Rob Has a Podcast ranked Winners at War 7th during their Survivor All-Time Top 40 Rankings podcast.\nHolmes was critical of the "nightmarish" Edge of Extinction twist; he said: "under normal circumstances, I’d have been rooting for [Natalie Anderson]. But it demonstrates the inherent flaw in the Edge. It punishes those who make it far while rewarding those voted out earlier." Ross also criticized the return of the Edge of Extinction, stating "This isn’t even about fairness or anything like that — although Nick lasting all the way to day 34 and having zero opportunities to earn a single token before the competition certainly is anything but fair — but more about what makes for a more dramatic and intriguing contest."\nAt the conclusion of the season, the three finalists were added to The Ringer\'s Hall of Fame of Survivor players, which already consisted of fellow Winners at War contestants Mariano, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Parvati Shallow. For their performances over the course of multiple seasons, Lacina and Spradlin-Wolfe were also added to the list, as were Jeremy Collins, Tyson Apostol, Ethan Zohn, and Yul Kwon.\n\n\n=== Viewing figures ===\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\n\n==== Canada ====\n\n== References ==\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial CBS Survivor Website', 'List of Survivor (American TV series) contestants': 'Winners of Survivor: Richard Hatch (Borneo) Tina Wesson (The Australian Outback) Ethan Zohn (Africa) Vecepia Towery (Marquesas) Brian Heidik (Thailand) Jenna Morasca (The Amazon) Sandra Diaz-Twine (Pearl Islands and Heroes vs. Villains) Amber Brkich (All-Stars) Chris Daugherty (Vanuatu) Tom Westman (Palau) Danni Boatwright (Guatemala) Aras Baskauskas (Panama) Yul Kwon (Cook Islands) Earl Cole (Fiji) Todd Herzog (China) Parvati Shallow (Micronesia) Bob Crowley (Gabon) James "J.T."

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
