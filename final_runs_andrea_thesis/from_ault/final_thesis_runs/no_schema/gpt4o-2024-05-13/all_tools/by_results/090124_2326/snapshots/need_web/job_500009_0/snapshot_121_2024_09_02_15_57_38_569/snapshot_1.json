{"type":"node","id":"48","labels":["Description"],"properties":{"text":"The picture titled 'Curiosity's View' was taken by the Curiosity Mars Rover and shows a dramatic panoramic view of diverse terrain on Mars. The image was recorded with Curiosity's Mast Camera instrument and looks south across gravel, sand ripples, and boulders toward rounded buttes. The higher layers at the left are toward the southeast, with the southwest at the panorama right. The individual images composing the view were taken on Curiosity's mission sols 952 and 953 since the rover's landing on August 6, 2012."}}
{"type":"node","id":"49","labels":["Image"],"properties":{"description":"The image depicts a barren, rocky landscape that appears to be a desert or an extraterrestrial terrain, possibly Mars. The ground is covered with a mixture of fine sand and scattered rocks of various sizes. The terrain is uneven, with small hills and ridges in the background.\n\nKey features of the image include:\n\n1. **Foreground**: The foreground is dominated by a flat, sandy surface with numerous small rocks and pebbles scattered across it. The sand appears to have a reddish-brown hue, typical of Martian soil.\n\n2. **Midground**: Moving further back, the terrain becomes more rugged with larger rocks and boulders. There are also visible patterns in the sand, possibly formed by wind erosion, creating small dunes or ripples.\n\n3. **Background**: The background features a series of low hills or ridges. The color of the hills is a lighter shade of brown, indicating a different composition or perhaps the effect of lighting. The sky above the horizon is a pale, almost white color, suggesting a thin atmosphere or a hazy day.\n\nOverall, the landscape is desolate and devoid of any vegetation or water, emphasizing the harsh and arid conditions of the environment.","caption":"Curiosity's View"}}

{"type":"node","id":"51","labels":["Description"],"properties":{"text":"The picture showing the lights of a city on the horizon during the first week of August 2015 is titled 'Full Moon, Full Earth'. It was captured by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on July 16, 2015. The image shows a Full Moon crossing in front of a Full Earth, with Earth's north pole near 11 o'clock and North America near the center. The image also highlights the small dark spot of the farside's Mare Moscoviense (Sea of Moscow) at the upper left. Slight color shifts around the lunar edge are due to the Moon's motion through the field caused by combining the camera's separate exposures taken in quick succession through different color filters."}}
