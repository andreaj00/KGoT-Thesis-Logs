{"type":"node","id":"66","labels":["Figure"],"properties":{"description":"The image is a logo or banner for an event titled \"ACCESSIBILITY FORUM 2024.\" The text is presented in a modern, sans-serif font. The word \"ACCESSIBILITY\" is in uppercase letters and is colored in a light green shade. The word \"FORUM\" is also in uppercase letters and is in the same light green color. The year \"2024\" is in a slightly different style and is colored in a dark gray shade. The overall design is clean and straightforward, with a focus on readability and a contemporary aesthetic. The use of different colors for the year \"2024\" helps to distinguish it from the rest of the text."}}
{"type":"node","id":"67","labels":["Figure"],"properties":{"description":"The image features the logo and name of Cornell University. The logo is positioned to the left and consists of a shield with various elements inside it. The shield is divided into sections, with each section containing different symbols. To the right of the shield, the text \"Cornell University\" is written in a clean, serif font. The entire design is rendered in white against a dark background, which makes the text and logo stand out prominently. The overall design is simple, elegant, and professional, reflecting the prestigious nature of the institution."}}

The logo consists of the word \"arXiv\" written in a stylized font. The letters are white and set against a black background. The \"X\" in \"arXiv\" is particularly distinctive, as it is designed to look like two intersecting lines, giving it a unique and recognizable appearance. The overall design is clean and modern, emphasizing simplicity and clarity."}}

The shapes appear to be elongated and slightly curved, crossing each other at an angle. The design is rendered in white against a black background, creating a stark contrast. The overall appearance is minimalist and geometric, with clean lines and a modern aesthetic. There is no text or additional elements present in the image."}}
