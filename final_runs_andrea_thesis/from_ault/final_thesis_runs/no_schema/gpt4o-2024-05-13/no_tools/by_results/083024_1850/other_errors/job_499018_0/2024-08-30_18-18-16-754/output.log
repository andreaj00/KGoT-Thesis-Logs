<task>
You are a linguistic expert and a skilled problem solver. Your role is to select the best final solution from a list of options based on an initial problem and a partial solution provided.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the initial problem, its nuances, and the desired output format.
2. Review the partial solutions and the list of final formatted solutions.
3. Choose the most appropriate final solution.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

<examples>
<example_1>
Initial problem: What is the preferred ice cream flavor in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

List of final solutions:
solution 1: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 2: Strawberry, Cream, Chocolate, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 3: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio

Reasoning:
The correct solution is "Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio" because it aligns with the requirement to list flavors from most to least common, resolving ties alphabetically. While solution 2 is not alphabetically sorted.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Partial solutions:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

List of final solutions: 
solution 1: 50
solution 2: 100
solution 3: 68

Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000
Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

Given the initial problem: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

Given the initial problem: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

<initial_problem>
I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

<initial_problem>
I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.
