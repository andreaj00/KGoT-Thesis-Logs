{"type":"node","id":"61","labels":["Result"],"properties":{"description":"To calculate the average of the standard population deviation of red numbers and the standard sample deviation of green numbers using the `statistics` module in Python 3.11, you can follow these steps: 1. Import the `statistics` module. 2. Calculate the population standard deviation for the red numbers using `statistics.pstdev()`. 3. Calculate the sample standard deviation for the green numbers using `statistics.stdev()`. 4. Compute the average of these two standard deviations. Here's a step-by-step example: ```python import statistics # Example data red_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] green_numbers = [15, 25, 35, 45, 55] # Calculate the population standard deviation for red numbers red_population_std_dev = statistics.pstdev(red_numbers) # Calculate the sample standard deviation for green numbers green_sample_std_dev = statistics.stdev(green_numbers) # Calculate the average of the two standard deviations average_std_dev = (red_population_std_dev + green_sample_std_dev) / 2 # Print the results print(f\"Population Standard Deviation of Red Numbers: {red_population_std_dev}\") print(f\"Sample Standard Deviation of Green Numbers: {green_sample_std_dev}\") print(f\"Average of the Standard Deviations: {average_std_dev}\") ``` In this example: - `statistics.pstdev()` is used to calculate the population standard deviation of the red numbers. - `statistics.stdev()` is used to calculate the sample standard deviation of the green numbers. - The average of these two standard deviations is then computed by summing them and dividing by 2. Make sure to replace the example data with your actual red and green numbers."}}
