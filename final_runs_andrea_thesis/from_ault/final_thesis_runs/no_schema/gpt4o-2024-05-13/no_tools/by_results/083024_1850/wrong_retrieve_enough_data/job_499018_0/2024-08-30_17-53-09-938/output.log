<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.

<task>
You are a linguistic expert and a skilled problem solver. Your role is to select the best final solution from a list of options based on an initial problem and a partial solution provided.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the initial problem, its nuances, and the desired output format.
2. Review the partial solutions and the list of final formatted solutions.
3. Choose the most appropriate final solution.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

<examples>
<example_1>
Initial problem: What is the preferred ice cream flavor in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

List of final solutions:
solution 1: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 2: Strawberry, Cream, Chocolate, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 3: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio

Reasoning:
The correct solution is "Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio" because it aligns with the requirement to list flavors from most to least common, resolving ties alphabetically. While solution 2 is not alphabetically sorted.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Partial solutions:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

List of final solutions: 
solution 1: 50
solution 2: 100
solution 3: 68

Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000
Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

<task>
You are a linguistic expert and a skilled problem solver. Your role is to select the best final solution from a list of options based on an initial problem and a partial solution provided.
</task>

<instructions>
1. Analyze the initial problem, its nuances, and the desired output format.
2. Review the partial solutions and the list of final formatted solutions.
3. Choose the most appropriate final solution.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"final_solution": {"title": "Final Solution", "description": "The correctly formatted final solution", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["final_solution"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.
</output_instructions>

<examples>
<example_1>
Initial problem: What is the preferred ice cream flavor in the household? Sort the solution from most common to least common. Separate them using commas, and in case of a tie, sort alphabetically.
Partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

List of final solutions:
solution 1: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 2: Strawberry, Cream, Chocolate, Lemon, Pistachio
solution 3: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio

Reasoning:
The correct solution is "Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio" because it aligns with the requirement to list flavors from most to least common, resolving ties alphabetically. While solution 2 is not alphabetically sorted.
</example_1>

<example_2>
Initial problem: What is the net profit for Q1 of the company? (Answer rounded to thousands of dollars)
Partial solutions:
1. Revenue:
   - January: $50000
   - February: $55000
   - March: $60000
2. Expenses:
   - January: $30000
   - February: $32000
   - March: $35000
3. Net Profit Calculation:
   - Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses

List of final solutions: 
solution 1: 50
solution 2: 100
solution 3: 68

Reasoning:
Using the formula Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses, the net profits for Q1 were:
- January: $20000
- February: $23000
- March: $25000
Total Net Profit for Q1: $68,000, rounded to 68 as per the requirement to round to thousands of dollars.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

1. **Pressure**: The pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench is extraordinarily high due to the immense weight of the overlying water. It is approximately 1,086 bars (108.6 MPa or 15,750 psi), which is more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level.

2. **Temperature**: The temperature at the bottom of the trench is just above freezing, typically ranging from 1 to 4 degrees Celsius (34 to 39 degrees Fahrenheit). Despite the high pressure, the temperature remains low because sunlight does not penetrate to these depths, and the water is isolated from warmer surface currents.

These extreme conditions make the Mariana Trench a unique and challenging environment for scientific exploration and study.

2024-08-30 17:59:28,904 — Controller — INFO — _invoke_tools_after_llm_response:401 — Tool 'llm_query' output: To determine the density of Freon-12 (CCl₂F₂) at a pressure of 1086 bars and a temperature between 1 to 4 degrees Celsius, we need to refer to specific thermodynamic data or equations of state for this substance under the given conditions. Freon-12 is a refrigerant, and its properties under various conditions are well-documented in specialized references.

Given the high pressure (1086 bars) and the low temperature range (1 to 4 degrees Celsius), Freon-12 is likely to be in a liquid state. The density of liquid Freon-12 can be found in tables or calculated using an appropriate equation of state.

For a rough estimate, we can use typical values from literature. At standard conditions (1 bar and 25°C), the density of liquid Freon-12 is approximately 1.486 g/cm³. However, at much higher pressures, the density will be significantly higher.

To get an accurate value, you would typically use data from sources such as the NIST Chemistry WebBook or other detailed thermodynamic tables for Freon-12. Unfortunately, without access to these specific tables or software, I can only provide an approximate range.

At 1086 bars and temperatures between 1 to 4 degrees Celsius, the density of liquid Freon-12 is likely to be in the range of 1.5 to 1.6 g/cm³, but for precise values, consulting detailed thermodynamic data is necessary.

If you have access to such data or software, you can input the specific conditions to get an exact value. Alternatively, contacting a chemical supplier or a reference library with access to detailed refrigerant properties might be necessary for precise information.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

However, I can provide some general information based on typical data available up to that point.

In the United States, the recycling rate for plastic bottles can vary depending on the type of plastic and the region. For example, the recycling rate for PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles, which are commonly used for beverages, has been around 29% in recent years. This rate can fluctuate based on various factors such as local recycling programs, consumer behavior, and market conditions.

Regarding the monetary value per recycled bottle, this can also vary. Some states in the U.S. have container deposit laws (also known as bottle bills) that provide a financial incentive for recycling. In these states, consumers can receive a refund for returning bottles and cans, typically ranging from $0.05 to $0.10 per container. The actual value can depend on the type of bottle and the specific state's regulations.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest statistics on recycling rates and monetary values from reliable sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the specific Wikipedia page you are interested in.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.

Given partial solution:
- Mom likes Cream
- Dad likes Chocolate
- Uncle likes Strawberry
- Auntie likes Strawberry
- Grandpa likes Pistachio
- Grandma likes Lemon

Solution: Strawberry, Chocolate, Cream, Lemon, Pistachio
Reasoning:
Strawberry is liked by 2 people, while the other flavors are each liked by 1 person. Therefore, Strawberry comes first, and the rest are sorted alphabetically.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.

These classes incorporate holy magic into their abilities and playstyles, each in unique ways that fit their thematic roles within the game.

<task>
You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
</output_format>

<output_instructions>
Output only the JSON, with no additional text.

You are an expert in identifying the need for mathematical or probabilistic calculations in problem-solving scenarios. Given an initial query and a partial solution, your task is to determine whether the partial solution requires further mathematical or probabilistic calculations to arrive at a complete solution. You will return a boolean value: True if additional calculations are needed and False if they are not.
</task>

<instructions>
- Analyze the initial query and the provided partial solution.
- Identify any elements in the query and partial solution that suggest the further need for numerical analysis, calculations, or probabilistic reasoning.
- Consider if the partial solution includes all necessary numerical results or if there are unresolved numerical aspects.
- Return true if the completion of the solution requires more calculations, otherwise return false.
- Focus on the necessity for calculations rather than the nature of the math or probability involved.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output your solution in the following JSON structure:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"need_for_math": {"title": "Need For Math", "description": "Boolean indicating whether we need further math or probability calculations", "type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["need_for_math"]}
```
