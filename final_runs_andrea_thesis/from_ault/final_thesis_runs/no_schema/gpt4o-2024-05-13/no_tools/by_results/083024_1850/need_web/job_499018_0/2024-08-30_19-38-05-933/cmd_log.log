Solving question 1:

Query: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo.

I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

Solving question 10:
file_names: ['']
Query: In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the "dried and dehydrated section" specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards?

Query: I was referencing each of the tables in the file from papers that were cited by the "Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey" paper. I lost my own reference sheet and need to know which of the papers each table came from. The file may not use the full table caption. If the references in the"Trans fatty acid" paper bibliography were numbered starting with 1, give me the numbers in the order that they would be used to fill the cells in the Excel file from top to bottom, as a comma separated list.

Solving question 155:
file_names: ['']
Query: I read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.
