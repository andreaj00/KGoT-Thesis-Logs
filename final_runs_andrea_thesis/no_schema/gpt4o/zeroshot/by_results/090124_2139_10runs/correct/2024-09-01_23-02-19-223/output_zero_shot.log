I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying. Could you please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described? I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make my favorite pie crust. I've attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.

In your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if the recipe calls for "a pinch of salt" or "two cups of ripe strawberries" the ingredients on the list would be "salt" and "ripe strawberries".

Please format your response as a comma separated list of ingredients. Also, please alphabetize the ingredients.

The Malko Competition is an international competition for young conductors. If you're looking for a recipient from the 20th century after 1977 whose nationality was from a country that no longer exists, you might be thinking of someone from a country like Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, or Czechoslovakia, as these countries have since dissolved.\n\nOne notable conductor who fits this description is **Sian Edwards**, who won the Malko Competition in 1984. However, she is British, and the UK still exists. \n\nAnother possibility is **Vladimir Jurowski**, who won the competition in 1995. He was born in Moscow, which was part of the Soviet Union at the time, a country that no longer exists.\n\nIf you can provide more specific details or clarify the attached documents, I might be able to give a more precise answer." response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 201, 'prompt_tokens': 52, 'total_tokens': 253}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-c91e6d50-29e9-473c-b616-03c4e5acaab8-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 52, 'output_tokens': 201, 'total_tokens': 253}
