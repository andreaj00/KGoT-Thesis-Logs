Could you please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described? I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make my favorite pie crust. I've attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.

In your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if the recipe calls for "a pinch of salt" or "two cups of ripe strawberries" the ingredients on the list would be "salt" and "ripe strawberries".

Please format your response as a comma separated list of ingredients. Also, please alphabetize the ingredients.

However, since the documents are not actually attached in this interface, I can provide some general information that might help.\n\nThe Malko Competition, also known as the Malko Competition for Young Conductors, is an international competition for young conductors. It has been held in Copenhagen, Denmark, since 1965. The competition is named after the Russian conductor Nicolai Malko.\n\nIf we are looking for a recipient from the 20th century (after 1977) whose nationality was from a country that no longer exists, we might consider countries like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, or Czechoslovakia, which dissolved in the late 20th century.\n\nOne notable recipient who fits this description is the conductor Dmitri Kitayenko, who won the Malko Competition in 1969. However, this is before 1977. Another possibility is the conductor who won in 1986, who was from Yugoslavia, a country that no longer exists in its former form.\n\nTo provide a precise answer, I would need the specific details from the documents you intended to attach.
