Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you need to consider the mechanics of the game and the random nature of the piston firings. The key is to determine which ball has the highest probability of being ejected by one of the pistons.

Given the rules:
1. The ramp starts with 100 balls, numbered 1 to 100.
2. The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are placed on the platform.
3. At each stage, one of the three pistons randomly fires, ejecting the ball it strikes.
4. The positions of the balls on the platform change based on which piston fires.

The game is essentially a random process where each ball has an equal chance of being ejected once it reaches the platform. However, the first few balls have a higher probability of being ejected sooner because they are already on the platform when the game starts.

To maximize your odds, you should choose one of the first three balls (1, 2, or 3) because they are already on the platform and will be subject to the random piston firings from the very beginning. Among these three, each has an equal chance of being ejected first.

Therefore, you can choose any of the first three balls. For simplicity, let's choose ball number 1.

So, the ball you should choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize is:

**1**)

Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve this problem, we need to identify the correct weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns. Let's start by understanding the validation method for these numbers.

Given a number in the format of ISBN-13, the checksum digit is calculated using alternating weights of 1 and some other positive integer \( w \) (where \( 1 \leq w < 10 \)). The checksum digit \( d_{12} \) is calculated such that the sum of the weighted digits modulo 10 is zero.

The general formula for the checksum digit is:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{11} d_i \cdot w_i + d_{12} \equiv 0 \pmod{10} \]
where \( w_i \) alternates between 1 and \( w \).

Given the numbers:
```
978-354181391-9
978-946669746-1
978-398036139-6
978-447656680-4

978-591178125-5
978-728465924-5
978-414825155-9
```

We need to find the weight \( w \) and the smaller index \( y \) of the two transposed columns. Let's start by calculating the checksum for each number assuming no transposition and then identify the error.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the digits and calculate the checksum for each number:**

   For the first number `978-354181391-9`:
   ```
   Digits: 9 7 8 3 5 4 1 8 1 3 9 1 9
   Weights: 1 w 1 w 1 w 1 w 1 w 1 w 1
   ```

   The checksum calculation without transposition:
   \[
   9 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot w + 8 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot w + 5 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot w + 1 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot w + 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot w + 9 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot w + 9
   \]

   This should be congruent to 0 modulo 10.

2. **Repeat for each number and identify the error:**

   We need to find the weight \( w \) and the transposed columns that make the checksum valid for all numbers.

### Testing Different Weights and Transpositions:

Let's test different weights \( w \) from 2 to 9 and check for valid transpositions.

#### Weight \( w = 2 \):

For `978-354181391-9`:
```
9*1 + 7*2 + 8*1 + 3*2 + 5*1 + 4*2 + 1*1 + 8*2 + 1*1 + 3*2 + 9*1 + 1*2 + 9
= 9 + 14 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 9
= 94
```
94 % 10 = 4 (not valid)

#### Weight \( w = 3 \):

For `978-354181391-9`:
```
9*1 + 7*3 + 8*1 + 3*3 + 5*1 + 4*3 + 1*1 + 8*3 + 1*1 + 3*3 + 9*1 + 1*3 + 9
= 9 + 21 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 12 + 1 + 24 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 3 + 9
= 120
```
120 % 10 = 0 (valid)

Now, we need to check if this weight works for all numbers with potential transpositions.

#### Check for transpositions:

We need to find the transposed columns that make the checksum valid for all numbers. Let's test transpositions for weight \( w = 3 \).

For `978-946669746-1`:
```
9*1 + 7*3 + 8*1 + 9*3 + 4*1 + 6*3 + 6*1 + 6*3 + 9*1 + 7*3 + 4*1 + 6*3 + 1
= 9 + 21 + 8 + 27 + 4 + 18 + 6 + 18 + 9 + 21 + 4 + 18 + 1
= 164
```
164 % 10 = 4 (not valid)

We need to find the transposed columns that make the checksum valid.

After testing different transpositions, we find that transposing columns 4 and 5 (0-indexed) makes the checksum valid for all numbers with weight \( w = 3 \).

### Conclusion:

The potential solution is:
\[ 3, 4 \]

This means the weight \( w \) is 3, and the smaller index of the two transposed columns is 4.)

Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by the residents of Șirnea and apply the known rules about humans and vampires.

1. **Humans always tell the truth.**
2. **Vampires always lie.**

You asked each of the 100 residents, "How many vampires are living in Șirnea?" and everyone responded, "At least one of us is a human."

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: All Residents are Vampires
- If all 100 residents were vampires, they would all lie. 
- A vampire would lie and say, "At least one of us is a human," which is a false statement if all are vampires.
- This scenario is consistent with the given responses because vampires lie, and saying "at least one of us is a human" would be a lie if there were no humans.

### Scenario 2: At Least One Human Exists
- If there is at least one human, the human would tell the truth.
- The human would say, "At least one of us is a human," which is a true statement.
- Vampires, on the other hand, would lie. If they were to lie about the number of humans, they would say something false. However, if they say "at least one of us is a human," it would be a lie only if there were no humans, which contradicts the presence of a human.

Given that all 100 residents gave the same response, "At least one of us is a human," and considering the nature of truth-telling and lying:

- If there were any humans, they would truthfully say, "At least one of us is a human."
- Vampires would lie, but in this case, their lie would be consistent with the statement if there were no humans.

Since the statement "At least one of us is a human" is consistent with the behavior of vampires lying (if there are no humans), the only logical conclusion is:

**All 100 residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires.**

Therefore, the number of residents who have been turned into vampires is **100**.)

Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To determine the minimum amount of money Bob can win using the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the constraints and the rules of the game.

### Constraints:
1. There are 30 coins in total.
2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let the number of coins in the three boxes be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
   \[
   a + b + c = 30
   \]
   and
   \[
   a = b + 6 \quad \text{(one box has 6 more coins than another)}
   \]

2. **Identify the Possible Distributions:**
   Given \(a = b + 6\), we can substitute \(a\) in the total sum equation:
   \[
   (b + 6) + b + c = 30
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2b + c + 6 = 30 \implies 2b + c = 24 \implies c = 24 - 2b
   \]

   We also know that one box must contain at least 2 coins, so:
   \[
   b \geq 2 \quad \text{and} \quad c \geq 2
   \]

3. **Determine the Range for \(b\):**
   Since \(c = 24 - 2b\) and \(c \geq 2\):
   \[
   24 - 2b \geq 2 \implies 22 \geq 2b \implies b \leq 11
   \]
   Therefore, \(b\) ranges from 2 to 11.

4. **Possible Values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):**
   - If \(b = 2\), then \(a = 8\) and \(c = 20\)
   - If \(b = 3\), then \(a = 9\) and \(c = 18\)
   - If \(b = 4\), then \(a = 10\) and \(c = 16\)
   - If \(b = 5\), then \(a = 11\) and \(c = 14\)
   - If \(b = 6\), then \(a = 12\) and \(c = 12\)
   - If \(b = 7\), then \(a = 13\) and \(c = 10\)
   - If \(b = 8\), then \(a = 14\) and \(c = 8\)
   - If \(b = 9\), then \(a = 15\) and \(c = 6\)
   - If \(b = 10\), then \(a = 16\) and \(c = 4\)
   - If \(b = 11\), then \(a = 17\) and \(c = 2\)

5. **Optimal Strategy for Bob:**
   Bob should guess the minimum number of coins in each box to ensure he wins the maximum possible amount. The optimal strategy is to guess the minimum number of coins that could be in any box, which is 2 coins.

### Calculation of Minimum Guaranteed Win:
- If Bob guesses 2 coins for each box, he will win at least 2 coins from each box, regardless of the actual distribution.

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win is:
\[
2 \text{ coins} \times 3 \text{ boxes} \times \$1,000 \text{ per coin} = \$6,000
\]

Therefore, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$6,000**.)

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: To convert the given symbols from the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system into Arabic numerals, we need to understand the value of each cuneiform symbol in the context of the Babylonian base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

The symbols provided are:
𒐜  𒐐𒐚

First, let's break down the symbols:

1. 𒐜: This symbol represents the number 1 in the Babylonian system.
2. 𒐐𒐚: This combination of symbols represents the number 59 in the Babylonian system.

In the Babylonian system, numbers are written in a positional notation similar to our decimal system, but with base 60 instead of base 10. Each position represents a power of 60.

Given the symbols:
- 𒐜 (1) is in the first position (units place).
- 𒐐𒐚 (59) is in the second position (60s place).

To convert this to a decimal number, we calculate the value of each position and sum them up:

- The value of 𒐐𒐚 (59) in the 60s place is \( 59 \times 60 = 3540 \).
- The value of 𒐜 (1) in the units place is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

Adding these values together:
\[ 3540 + 1 = 3541 \]

Therefore, the number represented by the symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚 in the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system is 3541 in Arabic numerals.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given and deduce the colors of the removed cube. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cube Types and Counts**:
   - 6 center cubes (one colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each)

2. **Found Cubes**:
   - All blue cubes are found.
   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube are found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corners are found.
   - All green cubes that border yellow are found.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes are found.

3. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces, meaning it is an edge cube.

### Analysis:

- **Blue Cubes**: Since all blue cubes are found, none of the blue edge cubes can be the removed one.
- **Orange Center and Adjacent Cubes**: The orange center cube and the cubes directly adjacent to it (left, right, above, below) are found. This means the edge cubes adjacent to the orange center are not the removed cube.
- **Green Corners**: All green corners are found, so the removed cube is not a green corner.
- **Green Bordering Yellow**: All green cubes that border yellow are found, so the removed cube is not a green-yellow edge cube.
- **Opposite Faces of Orange Cubes**: For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes are found. This means if an orange edge cube is found, the cube on the opposite face (which would be red) is also found.

### Deduction:

Given the constraints, we need to find an edge cube that:
- Is not blue.
- Is not adjacent to the orange center.
- Is not a green corner.
- Is not a green-yellow edge.
- Is not an orange edge cube (since the opposite face’s cube would also be found).

The only edge cubes left to consider are those that do not involve blue, green, or orange directly. The possible edge cubes are:
- Red-White
- Red-Yellow
- White-Yellow

Since the removed cube has two colors and must fit the criteria above, the only edge cube that fits all these conditions is the **Red-White** edge cube.

### Conclusion:

The colors of the removed cube are **Red** and **White**.

So, the answer is:
```
red,white
```)
