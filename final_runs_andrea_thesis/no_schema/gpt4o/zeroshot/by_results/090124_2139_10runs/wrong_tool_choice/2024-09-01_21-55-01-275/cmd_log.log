Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you need to consider the mechanics of the game and the random nature of the piston firings. The key is to understand the sequence in which the balls are ejected and how the positions on the platform change over time.

Given the rules:
1. The ramp starts with balls numbered 1 to 100 in ascending order.
2. The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are initially on the platform.
3. One of the three pistons randomly fires, ejecting the ball in its position.
4. The positions of the balls on the platform change based on which piston fires.

The goal is to determine which ball number has the highest probability of being ejected by one of the pistons.

### Analysis of the Game Mechanics

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Balls 1, 2, and 3 are on the platform.

2. **Random Ejection:**
   - Each piston has an equal probability (1/3) of firing.
   - The ball in the first position is ejected if the first piston fires.
   - The ball in the second position is ejected if the second piston fires.
   - The ball in the third position is ejected if the third piston fires.

3. **Position Changes:**
   - If the first piston fires, the ball in the first position is ejected, and the balls in the second and third positions move up one position, with the next ball from the ramp moving into the third position.
   - If the second piston fires, the ball in the second position is ejected, the ball in the third position moves to the first position, and the next two balls from the ramp move into the second and third positions.
   - If the third piston fires, the ball in the third position is ejected, the ball in the second position moves to the first position, and the next two balls from the ramp move into the second and third positions.

### Strategy to Maximize Winning Odds

Given the random nature of the piston firings and the continuous advancement of balls from the ramp, the ball that spends the most time on the platform has the highest probability of being ejected. The first few balls (1, 2, 3, etc.) will have more opportunities to be ejected because they start on the platform and are more likely to be in one of the three positions for a longer duration.

### Conclusion

To maximize your odds of winning, you should choose one of the first few balls. Specifically, the very first ball (number 1) will have the highest probability of being ejected because it starts in the first position and will be on the platform for the maximum possible time before being ejected.

**Therefore, you should choose ball number 1 to maximize your odds of winning the grand prize.**)

4. **Determine the heaviest compound by molecular weight**:
   - Among the shared gene-chemical co-occurrences, identify the compound with the highest molecular weight and find its PubChem CID.

Since I don't have access to the attached documents, I'll guide you through the process using the PubChem database:

### Step 1: Search for the Compound
Use the PubChem Compound search feature with the following filters:
- Molecular Weight: ≤ 100 g/mol
- Heavy Atoms: 6
- Hydrogen Bond Acceptors: ≤ 1
- Complexity: 10 to 15

### Step 2: Identify Possible Enzyme Transformations
Once you have identified the compound, look up its enzyme transformations. This information can typically be found in the compound's PubChem entry under the "Biological Test Results" or "Pathways" sections.

### Step 3: Find Shared Gene-Chemical Co-occurrences
For each enzyme transformation, check the associated genes and look for shared gene-chemical co-occurrences. This information might be available in the "Gene" section of the compound's PubChem entry or through related literature.

### Step 4: Determine the Heaviest Compound by Molecular Weight
Among the shared gene-chemical co-occurrences, identify the compound with the highest molecular weight. You can find the molecular weight and PubChem CID in the compound's PubChem entry.

### Example (Hypothetical)
Let's assume you found a compound with the following details:
- **Compound**: ExampleCompound
- **Molecular Weight**: 98 g/mol
- **Heavy Atoms**: 6
- **Hydrogen Bond Acceptors**: 1
- **Complexity**: 12

**Possible Enzyme Transformations**:

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve this problem, we need to identify the correct weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns. Let's start by understanding the validation method and then systematically check each possible weight and transposition.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Validation Method:**
   - The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer \( w \) (where \( 1 \leq w < 10 \)).
   - The formula for the checksum digit \( C \) is:
     \[
     C = 10 - \left( \sum_{i=0}^{11} d_i \times w_i \right) \mod 10
     \]
     where \( d_i \) are the digits of the number (excluding the checksum digit), and \( w_i \) are the weights alternating between 1 and \( w \).

2. **Identify the Transposed Columns:**
   - We need to find two adjacent columns that have been transposed. These columns are not the final column or one of the first three columns.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Weights and Transpositions:**
   - We will try each weight \( w \) from 2 to 9.
   - For each weight, we will check each possible pair of adjacent columns (from index 3 to 10) to see if transposing them results in a valid checksum.

### Calculation:

Let's denote the digits of the number (excluding the checksum digit) as \( d_0, d_1, \ldots, d_{11} \).

For each weight \( w \) and each possible transposition, we will:
1. Transpose the digits at indices \( y \) and \( y+1 \).
2. Calculate the checksum using the transposed digits.
3. Check if the calculated checksum matches the given checksum digit.

### Example Calculation for Weight \( w = 2 \):

Let's start with \( w = 2 \) and check each possible transposition.

#### For the first number: 978-354181391-9
- Original digits: 978354181391
- Checksum digit: 9

Let's try transposing columns 3 and 4:
- Transposed digits: 978543181391

Calculate the checksum:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Sum} &= 9 \times 1 + 7 \times 2 + 8 \times 1 + 5 \times 2 + 4 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 + 8 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 + 9 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 \\
&= 9 + 14 + 8 + 10 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 2 \\
&= 86
\end{align*}
\]
\[
C = 10 - (86 \mod 10) = 10 - 6 = 4 \quad (\text{not matching})
\]

We continue this process for each possible transposition and each weight.

### Summary of Potential Solutions:

After iterating through all possible weights and transpositions, we find the valid combinations where the calculated checksum matches the given checksum digit for all numbers.

Here are the potential solutions:

- **Weight \( w = 3 \), Transposed columns at index \( y = 4 \):**
  - This means the digits at indices 4 and 5 are transposed.

- **Weight \( w = 5 \), Transposed columns at index \( y = 6 \):**
  - This means the digits at indices 6 and 7 are transposed.

These are the potential solutions based on the given constraints and the validation method.)



Solving question 86:
Query: You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the statements made by the residents of Șirnea and apply the known rules about humans and vampires.

1. **Humans always tell the truth.**
2. **Vampires always lie.**

You asked each resident, "How many vampires are living in Șirnea?" and everyone responded, "At least one of us is a human."

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: All Residents are Vampires
- If all 100 residents were vampires, they would all lie. 
- Therefore, they would not truthfully say, "At least one of us is a human," because that would be a true statement.
- Since vampires always lie, they would say something false, such as "None of us are humans," which contradicts the given responses.

### Scenario 2: At Least One Human Exists
- If there is at least one human in the village, the human(s) would tell the truth.
- The truth-telling human(s) would say, "At least one of us is a human," which is a true statement.
- Vampires, on the other hand, would lie. If they were to lie about the number of humans, they would say something false. However, if they say, "At least one of us is a human," it would be a lie only if there were no humans at all, which we already ruled out in Scenario 1.

Given that everyone in the village says, "At least one of us is a human," and this statement is consistent across all residents, it implies that:

- The statement "At least one of us is a human" must be true.
- Therefore, there must be at least one human in the village.

Since the statement is true and humans tell the truth, the humans would say it truthfully. Vampires, who lie, would not say it unless it was a lie, but since the statement is true, it means the vampires are not contradicting the truth in this case.

### Conclusion
- The only way for the statement "At least one of us is a human" to be consistently given by all residents is if there is exactly one human in the village.
- This human tells the truth, and the vampires, who lie, would not contradict this truth in this specific context.

Thus, the number of residents who have been turned into vampires is:

\[ 100 - 1 = 99 \]

So, 99 residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires.)

Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from your original destination, let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the starting point and the destination:**
   - Starting Point: National Air and Space Museum (east of the Potomac River)
   - Destination: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport)

2. **Determine the nearest metro station to the National Air and Space Museum:**
   - The nearest metro station to the National Air and Space Museum is L'Enfant Plaza.

3. **Determine the nearest metro station to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF:**
   - The nearest metro station to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station.

4. **Identify the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School:**
   - The station closest to Cleveland Elementary School is Eastern Market.

5. **Determine the metro line and direction:**
   - From L'Enfant Plaza, you would typically take the Yellow Line or Blue Line southbound to reach Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
   - However, you went in the wrong direction and ended up at Eastern Market, which is on the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines.

6. **Calculate the number of stations between Eastern Market and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport without changing lines:**
   - If you are on the Blue Line, the stations from Eastern Market to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport are:
     1. Eastern Market
     2. Capitol South

Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

</attached_docs>
Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To determine the minimum amount of money Bob can win using the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the constraints and the possible distributions of the coins among the three boxes.

### Constraints:
1. There are 30 coins in total.
2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let the number of coins in the three boxes be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
   \[
   a + b + c = 30
   \]
   and
   \[
   \text{One box contains at least 2 coins.}
   \]
   and
   \[
   \text{One box contains 6 more coins than another box.}
   \]

2. **Possible Distributions:**
   We need to find all possible sets of \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the above conditions. Let's assume \(a \leq b \leq c\) without loss of generality.

   - If \(c = a + 6\), then:
     \[
     a + b + (a + 6) = 30 \implies 2a + b + 6 = 30 \implies 2a + b = 24 \implies b = 24 - 2a
     \]

   - Since \(a \geq 2\), we need to find valid integer solutions for \(a\) and \(b\):
     \[
     a \geq 2 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 24 - 2a \geq a
     \]

   - Solving \(24 - 2a \geq a\):
     \[
     24 \geq 3a \implies a \leq 8
     \]

   - Therefore, \(2 \leq a \leq 8\).

3. **Possible Values:**
   - For \(a = 2\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 2 = 20, \quad c = 2 + 6 = 8 \quad \text{(Invalid since \(b > c\))}
     \]
   - For \(a = 3\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 3 = 18, \quad c = 3 + 6 = 9 \quad \text{(Invalid since \(b > c\))}
     \]
   - For \(a = 4\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 4 = 16, \quad c = 4 + 6 = 10 \quad \text{(Invalid since \(b > c\))}
     \]
   - For \(a = 5\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 5 = 14, \quad c = 5 + 6 = 11 \quad \text{(Invalid since \(b > c\))}
     \]
   - For \(a = 6\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 6 = 12, \quad c = 6 + 6 = 12 \quad \text{(Valid)}
     \]
   - For \(a = 7\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 7 = 10, \quad c = 7 + 6 = 13 \quad \text{(Valid)}
     \]
   - For \(a = 8\):
     \[
     b = 24 - 2 \cdot 8 = 8, \quad c = 8 + 6 = 14 \quad \text{(Valid)}
     \]

   Valid distributions are:
   - \((6, 12, 12)\)
   - \((7, 10, 13)\)
   - \((8, 8, 14)\)

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   Bob should guess the minimum number of coins in each box to ensure he wins the maximum possible amount. The optimal guesses would be the minimum number of coins in each box for each valid distribution.

   - For \((6, 12, 12)\):
     Bob guesses 6, 12, and 12. He wins 6 + 12 + 12 = 30 coins.
   - For \((7, 10, 13)\):
     Bob guesses 7, 10, and 13. He wins 7 + 10 + 13 = 30 coins.
   - For \((8, 8, 14)\):
     Bob guesses 8, 8, and 14. He wins 8 + 8 + 14 = 30 coins.

### Conclusion:
Using the optimal strategy, Bob can ensure he wins all 30 coins, which translates to:
\[
30 \times \$1,000 = \$30,000
\]

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is \(\$30,000\).)

</attached_docs>
Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: To convert the given symbols from the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system into Arabic numerals, we need to understand the value of each cuneiform symbol in the context of the Babylonian base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

The symbols provided are:
𒐜  𒐐𒐚

First, let's break down the symbols:

1. 𒐜: This symbol represents the number 1 in the Babylonian system.
2. 𒐐𒐚: This combination of symbols represents the number 59 in the Babylonian system.

In the Babylonian system, numbers are written in a positional notation similar to our decimal system, but with base 60 instead of base 10. Each position represents a power of 60.

Given the symbols:
- 𒐜 (1) is in the first position (units place).
- 𒐐𒐚 (59) is in the second position (60s place).

To convert this to a decimal number, we calculate the value of each position and sum them up:

- The value of 𒐐𒐚 (59) in the 60s place is \( 59 \times 60 = 3540 \).
- The value of 𒐜 (1) in the units place is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

Adding these values together:
\[ 3540 + 1 = 3541 \]

Therefore, the number represented by the symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚 in the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system is 3541 in Arabic numerals.)

Query with Attached Docs: A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and deduce the colors of the removed cube. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cube Types and Counts**:
   - 6 center cubes (one colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each)

2. **Found Cubes**:
   - All blue cubes are found.
   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube are found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corners are found, along with all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces, meaning it is an edge cube.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **All Blue Cubes Found**:
   - There are 9 blue cubes (1 center, 4 edges, 4 corners).

2. **Orange Center and Adjacent Cubes**:
   - The orange center cube is found.
   - The 4 edge cubes adjacent to the orange center are found.

3. **Green Corners and Green-Yellow Edges**:
   - All 4 green corner cubes are found.
   - All green cubes that border yellow are found, which means the 4 green-yellow edge cubes are found.

4. **Opposite Faces of Orange Cubes**:
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes are found. This means if an orange cube is found, the cube on the opposite face of the Rubik’s cube is also found.

### Deduction:

- Since all blue cubes are found, the removed cube cannot have blue.
- Since all green corners and green-yellow edges are found, the removed cube cannot have green or yellow.
- Since all cubes adjacent to the orange center are found, the removed cube cannot be one of these.

Given the constraints, the only remaining colors for the removed edge cube are **orange** and **red**. 

### Conclusion:

The removed cube has two colors: **orange** and **red**. 

Thus, the answer is:

**orange,red**)
