Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you need to consider the mechanics of the game and the random nature of the piston firings. The key is to understand the sequence in which the balls are ejected and how the positions on the platform change over time.

Given the rules:
1. The ramp starts with balls numbered 1 to 100 in ascending order.
2. The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are initially on the platform.
3. One of the three pistons randomly fires, ejecting the ball in its position.
4. The positions of the balls on the platform change based on which piston fires.

The goal is to determine which ball has the highest probability of being ejected. 

### Analysis of the Game Mechanics

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Balls 1, 2, and 3 are on the platform.

2. **Piston Firings:**
   - If the first piston fires, ball 1 is ejected, and ball 4 moves to the third position.
   - If the second piston fires, ball 2 is ejected, ball 3 moves to the first position, and balls 4 and 5 move to the second and third positions, respectively.
   - If the third piston fires, ball 3 is ejected, ball 1 moves to the first position, and balls 4 and 5 move to the second and third positions, respectively.

3. **Subsequent Firings:**
   - The process continues with the next balls on the ramp filling the positions on the platform as balls are ejected.

### Key Insight

The first few balls (1, 2, 3, etc.) have a higher chance of being ejected early because they start on the platform and are subject to the random piston firings from the beginning. As the game progresses, the balls that are initially on the ramp (higher numbers) will have fewer opportunities to be ejected because they will only reach the platform after many firings.

### Probability Consideration

Since the pistons fire randomly and each ball on the platform has an equal chance of being ejected, the balls that start on the platform (1, 2, and 3) have the highest probability of being ejected first. Among these, the ball in the first position (ball 1) is most likely to be ejected first because it is immediately subject to the random piston firings.

### Conclusion

To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected first. Given the initial setup and the random nature of the piston firings, the ball in the first position (ball 1) has the highest probability of being ejected.

**Therefore, you should choose ball number 1.**)

Solving question 50:
Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve this problem, we need to identify the correct weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns. Let's start by understanding the validation method and then systematically check each possible weight and transposition.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Validation Method:**
   - The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer \( w \) (where \( 1 \leq w < 10 \)).
   - The formula for the checksum digit \( C \) is:
     \[
     C = 10 - \left( \sum_{i=0}^{11} d_i \times w_i \right) \mod 10
     \]
     where \( d_i \) are the digits of the number (excluding the checksum digit), and \( w_i \) are the weights alternating between 1 and \( w \).

2. **Identify the Transposed Columns:**
   - We need to find two adjacent columns that have been transposed. These columns are not the final column or one of the first three columns.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Weights and Transpositions:**
   - We will try each possible weight \( w \) from 2 to 9.
   - For each weight, we will check each possible pair of adjacent columns (from index 3 to 10) to see if transposing them results in a valid checksum.

### Calculation:

Let's denote the digits of the number as \( d_0, d_1, \ldots, d_{12} \), where \( d_{12} \) is the checksum digit.

For each weight \( w \) and each possible transposition, we will:
1. Transpose the digits at indices \( y \) and \( y+1 \).
2. Calculate the checksum using the transposed digits.
3. Check if the calculated checksum matches the given checksum digit.

### Example Calculation for Weight \( w = 2 \):

Let's start with \( w = 2 \) and check each possible transposition:

#### For \( y = 3 \):
- Transpose digits at indices 3 and 4.
- Calculate the checksum for each number and check if it matches the given checksum.

#### For \( y = 4 \):
- Transpose digits at indices 4 and 5.
- Calculate the checksum for each number and check if it matches the given checksum.

Continue this process for all possible \( y \) values and weights.

### Python Code to Automate the Process:

```python
def calculate_checksum(digits, weight):
    total = 0
    for i in range(12):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += digits[i]
        else:
            total += digits[i] * weight
    checksum = (10 - (total % 10)) % 10
    return checksum

                digits = [int(d) for d in number.replace('-', '')]
                # Transpose digits at indices y and y+1
                digits[y], digits[y+1] = digits[y+1], digits[y]
                if calculate_checksum(digits, weight) != digits[12]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                return weight, y
    return None

Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the statements made by the residents of Șirnea and apply the known rules about humans and vampires.

1. **Humans always tell the truth.**
2. **Vampires always lie.**

You asked each of the 100 residents, "How many vampires are living in Șirnea?" and everyone responded, "At least one of us is a human."

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: All Residents are Vampires
- If all 100 residents were vampires, they would all lie. 
- Therefore, they would not truthfully say, "At least one of us is a human," because that statement would be true, and vampires cannot tell the truth.
- This scenario is impossible because it contradicts the behavior of vampires.

### Scenario 2: At Least One Human Exists
- If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement "At least one of us is a human" is true.
- Humans tell the truth, so a human would indeed say, "At least one of us is a human."
- Vampires lie, so if a vampire says, "At least one of us is a human," it must be a lie. For it to be a lie, the statement "At least one of us is a human" must be false, which means there are no humans. This contradicts the assumption that there is at least one human.

Given that everyone in the village says, "At least one of us is a human," and considering the nature of truth-telling humans and lying vampires, the only consistent scenario is:

- There is exactly **one human** in the village.
- The human truthfully says, "At least one of us is a human."
- The 99 vampires lie by saying, "At least one of us is a human," which would be a lie if there were no humans, but since there is one human, their statement is consistent with their nature of lying.

### Conclusion
There is exactly **one human** in the village of Șirnea, and the remaining **99 residents are vampires**.)

Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To determine the minimum amount of money Bob can win using the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the constraints and the possible distributions of the coins among the three boxes.

### Constraints:
1. The total number of coins is 30.
2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let the number of coins in the three boxes be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
   \[
   a + b + c = 30
   \]
   and
   \[
   a = b + 6 \quad \text{(without loss of generality, assume \(a\) is the box with 6 more coins than \(b\))}
   \]

2. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   Substitute \(a = b + 6\) into the total coin equation:
   \[
   (b + 6) + b + c = 30
   \]
   Simplify to find \(c\):
   \[
   2b + 6 + c = 30
   \]
   \[
   2b + c = 24
   \]
   \[
   c = 24 - 2b
   \]

3. **Determine Valid Values for \(b\):**
   Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be non-negative integers and \(a \geq 2\):
   \[
   b + 6 \geq 2 \implies b \geq -4 \quad \text{(but \(b\) must be non-negative)}
   \]
   \[
   b \geq 0
   \]
   Also, \(c\) must be non-negative:
   \[
   24 - 2b \geq 0 \implies b \leq 12
   \]
   Therefore, \(b\) can range from 0 to 12.

4. **Possible Distributions:**
   We need to check the valid distributions:
   - For \(b = 0\), \(a = 6\), \(c = 24\)
   - For \(b = 1\), \(a = 7\), \(c = 22\)
   - For \(b = 2\), \(a = 8\), \(c = 20\)
   - ...
   - For \(b = 12\), \(a = 18\), \(c = 0\)

### Optimal Strategy:
Bob should guess the minimum number of coins in each box to ensure he wins the maximum possible amount. The optimal strategy is to guess the minimum number of coins in each box, which is 0, 0, and 0. However, since Bob must guess a number greater than or equal to the actual number of coins to win, he should guess the minimum number of coins that satisfies the constraints.

### Minimum Guaranteed Win:
Given the constraints, the minimum number of coins in any box is 2 (since one box must contain at least 2 coins). Therefore, Bob should guess 2 for the box with the minimum number of coins. For the other boxes, he should guess the minimum number of coins that satisfies the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The minimum amount of money Bob can win, using the optimal strategy, is determined by the smallest number of coins in any box, which is 2. Therefore, Bob can guarantee to win at least 2 coins, which translates to:
\[
2 \times \$1,000 = \$2,000
\]

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game is **$2,000**.)

</attached_docs>
Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: To convert the given symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 from the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system into Arabic numerals, we need to understand the value of each symbol in the context of the Babylonian base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

The Babylonian number system uses a combination of two basic symbols to represent numbers:
- A vertical wedge (𒐐) represents the value 1.
- A corner wedge (𒐚) represents the value 10.

The symbol 𒐜 is a combination of these basic symbols and represents the number 20 (two corner wedges).

Let's break down the given symbols:
1. 𒐜 represents 20.
2. 𒐐𒐚 represents 1 + 10 = 11.

In the Babylonian system, the position of the symbols is crucial because it is a base-60 system. The first symbol (from the left) represents the higher place value (60^1), and the second symbol represents the lower place value (60^0).

So, the number 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 can be interpreted as:
- 𒐜 (20) in the 60^1 place.
- 𒐐𒐚 (11) in the 60^0 place.

Now, we calculate the value in decimal (base-10):
- 20 * 60^1 = 20 * 60 = 1200
- 11 * 60^0 = 11 * 1 = 11

Adding these values together:
1200 + 11 = 1211

Therefore, the number 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system converts to 1211 in Arabic numerals as a decimal number.)

</attached_docs>
Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given and deduce the colors of the removed cube. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cube Types and Counts**:
   - 6 center cubes (one colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each)

2. **Found Cubes**:
   - All blue cubes are found.
   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube are found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corners are found.
   - All green cubes that border yellow are found.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes are found.

3. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces, meaning it is an edge cube.

### Analysis:

#### Step 1: Identify the Colors on the Cube
The Rubik's cube has six colors: blue, green, orange, red, white, and yellow.

#### Step 2: Determine the Missing Edge Cube
Since the removed cube is an edge cube, it must have two colors. We need to figure out which edge cube is missing based on the information provided.

- **All blue cubes are found**: This means no edge cube with blue is missing.
- **All cubes around the orange center are found**: This includes the edge cubes adjacent to the orange center.
- **All green corners are found**: This does not directly affect edge cubes.
- **All green cubes that border yellow are found**: This includes the green-yellow edge cubes.
- **For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes are found**: This means if an orange edge cube is found, the edge cube on the opposite face is also found.

#### Step 3: Deduce the Missing Edge Cube
Given the constraints, let's list the possible edge cubes and eliminate the ones that are found:

- Blue-White
- Blue-Red
- Blue-Yellow
- Blue-Orange
- Green-White
- Green-Red
- Green-Yellow
- Green-Orange
- Orange-White
- Orange-Red
- Red-White
- Red-Yellow

From the information:
- All blue edge cubes are found, so eliminate Blue-White, Blue-Red, Blue-Yellow, and Blue-Orange.
- All green-yellow edge cubes are found, so eliminate Green-Yellow.
- All cubes around the orange center are found, so eliminate Orange-White and Orange-Red.
- For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes are found, so if Orange-White and Orange-Red are found, their opposites (White-Red and Red-White) are also found.

This leaves us with:
- Green-White
- Green-Red
- Red-Yellow

Since all green corners are found and all green cubes that border yellow are found, Green-White and Green-Red must also be found.

Thus, the only remaining edge cube is **Red-Yellow**.

### Conclusion:
The removed cube has the colors **Red** and **Yellow**.

Answer: **red, yellow**)
