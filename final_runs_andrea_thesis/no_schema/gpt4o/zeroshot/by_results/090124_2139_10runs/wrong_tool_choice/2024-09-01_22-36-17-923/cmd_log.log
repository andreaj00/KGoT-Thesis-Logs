Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you need to consider the mechanics of the game and the random nature of the piston firings. The key is to understand the sequence in which the balls are ejected and how the positions on the platform change over time.

Given the rules:
1. The ramp starts with balls numbered 1 to 100.
2. The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are placed on the platform.
3. One of the three pistons randomly fires, ejecting the ball in its position.
4. The positions of the balls on the platform change based on which piston fires.

The goal is to determine which ball number has the highest probability of being ejected by one of the pistons.

### Analysis of the Game Mechanics

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Balls 1, 2, and 3 are on the platform.

2. **Piston Firings:**
   - If the piston ejects the ball in the first position, the balls in the second and third positions move up one space, and the next ball on the ramp moves to the third position.
   - If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released, the ball in the third position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move to the second and third positions.
   - If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released, the ball in the second position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move to the second and third positions.

### Strategy to Maximize Winning Odds

To maximize your odds, you should choose a ball that is likely to be on the platform for the longest duration, giving it more opportunities to be ejected. The first few balls (1, 2, 3) are initially on the platform and have the highest chance of being ejected early in the game. However, as the game progresses, the balls that are introduced later will have fewer opportunities to be ejected.

Given the random nature of the piston firings, the ball that is most likely to be ejected is one of the first few balls. Specifically, the first ball (number 1) has the highest probability of being ejected first because it starts in the first position and will be ejected if the first piston fires.

### Conclusion

To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose ball number **1**. This ball has the highest probability of being ejected first due to its initial position on the platform and the mechanics of the game.)

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve this problem, we need to identify the unknown weight \( w \) and the smaller index \( y \) of the two transposed columns. We will use the given numbers and their checksums to determine these values.

First, let's recall the general formula for calculating the checksum digit for an ISBN-13-like number with an alternate weight of 1 and \( w \):

\[ \text{Checksum} = 10 - \left( \sum_{i=0}^{11} a_i \cdot w_i \right) \mod 10 \]

where \( a_i \) is the \( i \)-th digit of the number, and \( w_i \) is the weight for the \( i \)-th position, alternating between 1 and \( w \).

Given the numbers:
1. 978-354181391-9
2. 978-946669746-1
3. 978-398036139-6

8. 978-591178125-5
9. 978-728465924-5
10. 978-414825155-9

We need to identify the transposed columns and the weight \( w \). Let's start by calculating the checksum for each number assuming no transposition and using different weights \( w \) from 2 to 9.

For simplicity, let's denote the digits of the number as \( d_0, d_1, \ldots, d_{12} \).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the transposed columns:**
   - We will try different pairs of adjacent columns (excluding the first three and the last one) and check if the checksum matches after transposing them.

2. **Calculate the checksum for each weight \( w \):**
   - For each weight \( w \) from 2 to 9, calculate the checksum for each number and compare it with the given checksum digit.

### Example Calculation for Weight \( w = 2 \):

Let's calculate the checksum for the first number (978-354181391-9) with \( w = 2 \):

Original number: 9783541813919

Weights: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2

Checksum calculation:
\[ 9 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 9 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \]

\[ = 9 + 14 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 2 \]

\[ = 85 \]

Checksum digit:
\[ 10 - (85 \mod 10) = 10 - 5 = 5 \]

The given checksum digit is 9, so this does not match. We need to try transposing columns and different weights.

### Trying Transpositions:

Let's try transposing columns 4 and 5 (indices 4 and 5):

Transposed number: 978-345181391-9

Checksum calculation with \( w = 2 \):
\[ 9 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 9 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \]

\[ = 9 + 14 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 2 \]

\[ = 86 \]

Checksum digit:
\[ 10 - (86 \mod 10) = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

This still does not match. We need to continue this process for other weights and transpositions.

### Final Solution:

After trying all possible weights and transpositions, we find that the correct weight and transposition that match all given checksums are:

Weight \( w = 3 \) and transposed columns at indices 5 and 6.

Thus, the solution is:
\[ 3, 5 \]

This means the weight is 3, and the smaller index of the two transposed columns is 5.)



Solving question 86:
Query: You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the statements made by the residents of Șirnea and apply the known rules about humans and vampires.

1. **Humans always tell the truth.**
2. **Vampires always lie.**

You asked each resident, "How many vampires are living in Șirnea?" and everyone responded, "At least one of us is a human."

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: All Residents are Vampires
- If all 100 residents were vampires, they would all lie. 
- A vampire would lie and say, "At least one of us is a human," which is a false statement if all are vampires.
- This scenario is impossible because it contradicts the rule that vampires always lie.

### Scenario 2: At Least One Human Exists
- If there is at least one human in the village, the statement "At least one of us is a human" would be true.
- Humans tell the truth, so a human would truthfully say, "At least one of us is a human."
- Vampires, who lie, would also say, "At least one of us is a human," because the opposite (which they would lie about) would be "None of us is a human," which is false if there is at least one human.

Given that everyone in the village gave the same response, "At least one of us is a human," and considering the rules about truth-telling and lying, the only consistent scenario is that there is exactly one human in the village. 

### Conclusion
- If there were more than one human, the statement would still hold true, but the consistency of the responses and the nature of the puzzle suggest a minimal number of humans.
- Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that there is exactly **one human** in the village, and the rest are vampires.

So, **99 residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires**.)

</attached_docs>
Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine the number of metro stations you are away from your original destination, let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the starting point and the destination:**
   - **Starting Point:** National Air and Space Museum (east of the Potomac River).
   - **Destination:** Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport).

2. **Determine the closest metro station to the starting point:**
   - The closest metro station to the National Air and Space Museum is **L'Enfant Plaza**.

3. **Determine the closest metro station to the destination:**
   - The closest metro station to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is **Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport** station.

4. **Identify the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School:**
   - The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is **Eastern Market**.

5. **Determine the metro line and direction:**
   - From L'Enfant Plaza, you would typically take the **Yellow Line** towards Huntington to reach Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
   - However, you went in the wrong direction and ended up at **Eastern Market**, which is on the **Blue/Orange/Silver Line**.

6. **Calculate the number of stations between Eastern Market and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport without changing lines:**
   - Since you are on the Blue Line at Eastern Market, you need to count the number of stations from Eastern Market to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on the Blue Line.

Here are the stations on the Blue Line from Eastern Market to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport:
   1. Eastern Market
   2. Capitol South
   3. Federal Center SW
   4. L'Enfant Plaza (transfer point, but you stay on the Blue Line)
   5. Smithsonian
   6. Federal Triangle
   7. Metro Center
   8. McPherson Square
   9. Farragut West
   10. Foggy Bottom-GWU
   11. Rosslyn
   12. Arlington Cemetery
   13. Pentagon
   14. Pentagon City
   15. Crystal City
   16. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport

Counting the stations from Eastern Market to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, we get a total of **15 stations**.

Therefore, you are **15 metro stations** away from your original destination if you don't change lines.)



Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

</attached_docs>
Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To determine the minimum amount of money Bob can win using the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the constraints and the possible distributions of the coins among the three boxes.

### Constraints:
1. There are 30 coins in total.
2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let the number of coins in the three boxes be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
   \[
   a + b + c = 30
   \]
   and
   \[
   a = b + 6 \quad \text{(without loss of generality, assume \(a\) is the box with 6 more coins than \(b\))}
   \]

2. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   Substitute \(a = b + 6\) into the total coin equation:
   \[
   (b + 6) + b + c = 30
   \]
   Simplify to find \(c\):
   \[
   2b + 6 + c = 30
   \]
   \[
   2b + c = 24
   \]
   \[
   c = 24 - 2b
   \]

3. **Determine Valid Values for \(b\):**
   Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer and \(b\) must be at least 2 (as one box must contain at least 2 coins):
   \[
   24 - 2b \geq 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b \leq 12
   \]
   \[
   b \geq 2
   \]

   Therefore, \(b\) can range from 2 to 12.

4. **Possible Distributions:**
   For each valid \(b\), calculate \(a\) and \(c\):
   - If \(b = 2\), then \(a = 8\) and \(c = 20\)
   - If \(b = 3\), then \(a = 9\) and \(c = 18\)
   - If \(b = 4\), then \(a = 10\) and \(c = 16\)
   - If \(b = 5\), then \(a = 11\) and \(c = 14\)
   - If \(b = 6\), then \(a = 12\) and \(c = 12\)
   - If \(b = 7\), then \(a = 13\) and \(c = 10\)
   - If \(b = 8\), then \(a = 14\) and \(c = 8\)
   - If \(b = 9\), then \(a = 15\) and \(c = 6\)
   - If \(b = 10\), then \(a = 16\) and \(c = 4\)
   - If \(b = 11\), then \(a = 17\) and \(c = 2\)
   - If \(b = 12\), then \(a = 18\) and \(c = 0\) (invalid since \(c\) must be non-zero)

### Optimal Strategy:
Bob should guess the minimum number of coins in each box to ensure he wins the maximum possible amount. The optimal strategy is to guess the minimum number of coins in each box, which is 2 (since one box must contain at least 2 coins).

### Minimum Amount Bob Can Win:
Given the optimal strategy, Bob will guess 2 coins for each box. Let's evaluate the minimum amount he can win for each valid distribution:

- For \(b = 2\), \(a = 8\), \(c = 20\):
  - Bob guesses 2 for each box:
    - Box with 8 coins: Bob wins 2 coins.
    - Box with 2 coins: Bob wins 2 coins.
    - Box with 20 coins: Bob wins 2 coins.
  - Total coins won: \(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\)

Since this is the minimum number of coins Bob can win across all valid distributions, the minimum amount of money Bob can win is:
\[
6 \times \$1,000 = \$6,000
\]

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$6,000**.)

This is a number written using the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system and represented with Sumerian cuneiform. Convert this number into Arabic numerals as a decimal number.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: To convert the given symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 from the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system into Arabic numerals, we need to understand the value of each symbol in the cuneiform script.

The Babylonian number system is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system. Here are the values of the cuneiform symbols used in the Babylonian number system:

- 𒐕 (vertical wedge) = 1
- 𒐖 (corner wedge) = 10

The given symbols are:
1. 𒐜
2. 𒐐𒐚

Let's break down each symbol:

1. 𒐜: This symbol represents the number 20 in the Babylonian system.
2. 𒐐𒐚: This combination represents the number 42 in the Babylonian system. The symbol 𒐐 represents 40 (4 corner wedges, each representing 10), and the symbol 𒐚 represents 2 (2 vertical wedges, each representing 1).

Now, we need to convert these values into a single decimal number. In the Babylonian system, the position of the symbols determines their value in powers of 60. Since there are two groups of symbols, the first group (𒐜) is in the 60^1 place, and the second group (𒐐𒐚) is in the 60^0 place.

So, the calculation is as follows:
- 𒐜 (20) in the 60^1 place: 20 * 60 = 1200
- 𒐐𒐚 (42) in the 60^0 place: 42 * 1 = 42

Adding these together:
1200 + 42 = 1242

Therefore, the number 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system converts to 1242 in Arabic numerals.)

- **All Blue Cubes Found**:
  - Blue center cube (1)
  - Blue edge cubes (4)
  - Blue corner cubes (4)

- **Orange Center and Adjacent Cubes**:
  - Orange center cube (1)
  - Adjacent edge cubes (4)

- **Green Corners and Green-Yellow Borders**:
  - Green corner cubes (4)
  - Green edge cubes bordering yellow (4)

- **Opposite Faces of Orange Cubes**:
  - If an orange cube is found, the cube on the opposite face is also found.

### Deduction:

Since all blue cubes are found, the removed cube cannot have blue.

Since all green corners and green-yellow bordering cubes are found, the removed cube cannot have green.

Since all cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube are found, the removed cube cannot be one of these.

Given the constraints, the removed cube must be an edge cube with two colors that are not blue or green. The remaining colors are orange, red, white, and yellow.

### Possible Edge Cubes:

- Orange-Red
- Orange-White
- Orange-Yellow
- Red-White
- Red-Yellow
- White-Yellow

Since all cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube are found, the removed cube cannot be an orange edge cube.

Thus, the possible edge cubes are:
- Red-White
- Red-Yellow
- White-Yellow

### Conclusion:

The removed cube must be one of the remaining edge cubes. Given the constraints and the process of elimination, the removed cube has the colors **red** and **yellow**.

So, the colors of the removed cube are:

**red, yellow**)
