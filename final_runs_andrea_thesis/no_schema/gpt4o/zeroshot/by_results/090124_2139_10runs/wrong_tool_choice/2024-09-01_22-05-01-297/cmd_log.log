Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you need to consider the mechanics of the game and the random nature of the pistons firing. The key is to determine which ball has the highest probability of being ejected by one of the pistons.

Given the rules:
1. The ramp starts with 100 balls, numbered 1 to 100.
2. The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are placed on the platform.
3. At each stage, one of the three pistons randomly fires, ejecting the ball it strikes.
4. The positions of the balls on the platform change based on which piston fires.

The game is essentially a random process where each ball has an equal chance of being ejected once it reaches the platform. However, the first few balls have a higher chance of being ejected earlier because they start on the platform and are subject to the random firing of the pistons from the beginning.

To maximize your odds, you should choose one of the first few balls because they will be on the platform for the longest duration and thus have the highest cumulative probability of being ejected.

Let's analyze the probabilities for the first few balls:
- Ball 1 starts on the platform and has a 1/3 chance of being ejected in the first round.
- If Ball 1 is not ejected, it remains on the platform and continues to have a chance of being ejected in subsequent rounds.
- Similarly, Ball 2 and Ball 3 also have high probabilities of being ejected early on.

Given that the first ball (Ball 1) is on the platform from the very beginning and has the highest cumulative exposure to the random firing of the pistons, it has the highest probability of being ejected.

Therefore, to maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose Ball 1.)

Query: My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12.

Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

From the above calculations, we see that the numbers 978-279586664-7 and 978-591178125-5 are valid with weight \( x = 2 \). However, the other numbers are invalid. We need to identify the transposed columns for these invalid numbers.

Let's try to identify the transposed columns for one of the invalid numbers, say 978-354181391-9, by swapping adjacent columns and checking if the number becomes valid.

#### Trying to correct 978-354181391-9 by swapping adjacent columns:
1. Swap columns 3 and 4:
   - 978-543181391-9
   - Sum: 9 + 14 + 8 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 9 = 101
   - Checksum: 101 % 10 = 1 (Invalid)

2. Swap columns 4 and 5:
   - 978-351481391-9
   - Sum: 9 + 14 + 8 + 6 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 9 = 90
   - Checksum: 90 % 10 = 0 (Valid)

The number becomes valid when we swap columns 4 and 5. Therefore, the smaller index of the transposed columns is 4.

Thus, one potential solution is \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 4 \).

We can repeat this process for other weights \( x \) from 3 to 9 to find all potential solutions. However, based on the above analysis, we have found one valid solution:

**Potential Solution: \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 4 \)**)

You asked each resident, "How many vampires are living in Șirnea?" and everyone responded, "At least one of us is a human."

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: All Residents are Vampires
- If all 100 residents were vampires, they would all lie. 
- A vampire would lie and say, "At least one of us is a human," which is a false statement if all are vampires.
- This scenario is consistent with the fact that vampires lie, but it contradicts the statement because if all were vampires, the statement "At least one of us is a human" would be false, and vampires would not say it.

### Scenario 2: At Least One Human Exists
- If there is at least one human in the village, the statement "At least one of us is a human" would be true.
- Humans tell the truth, so a human would truthfully say, "At least one of us is a human."
- Vampires lie, so a vampire would lie and say, "At least one of us is a human," which would be a false statement if there were no humans. However, since there is at least one human, the statement is true, and vampires would not say it.

Given that everyone in the village gave the same response, "At least one of us is a human," and considering the nature of truth-telling humans and lying vampires, the only consistent scenario is that there is exactly one human in the village. 

### Conclusion
- If there is exactly one human, the human would truthfully say, "At least one of us is a human."
- All the vampires would lie, but since the statement "At least one of us is a human" is true, the vampires would not contradict it directly.

Therefore, the number of residents who have been turned into vampires is:

\[ 100 - 1 = 99 \]

So, 99 residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires.)

Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To determine the minimum amount of money Bob can win using the optimal strategy, we need to analyze the constraints and the rules of the game.

### Constraints:
1. There are 30 coins in total.
2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let the number of coins in the three boxes be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
   \[
   a + b + c = 30
   \]
   and
   \[
   \text{One box contains at least 2 coins.}
   \]
   \[
   \text{One box contains 6 more coins than another box.}
   \]

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   Without loss of generality, assume \(a \leq b \leq c\). The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be written as:
   \[
   c = a + 6
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Substitute \(c = a + 6\) into the total sum equation:
   \[
   a + b + (a + 6) = 30
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2a + b + 6 = 30
   \]
   \[
   2a + b = 24
   \]
   \[
   b = 24 - 2a
   \]

4. **Determine Valid Values:**
   Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a \geq 2\):
   \[
   a \geq 2
   \]
   \[
   b = 24 - 2a \geq a
   \]
   \[
   24 - 2a \geq a
   \]
   \[
   24 \geq 3a
   \]
   \[
   a \leq 8
   \]

   Therefore, \(2 \leq a \leq 8\).

5. **Possible Distributions:**
   For each valid \(a\), calculate \(b\) and \(c\):
   - If \(a = 2\), \(b = 24 - 2(2) = 20\), \(c = 2 + 6 = 8\) (Invalid since \(b > c\))
   - If \(a = 3\), \(b = 24 - 2(3) = 18\), \(c = 3 + 6 = 9\) (Invalid since \(b > c\))
   - If \(a = 4\), \(b = 24 - 2(4) = 16\), \(c = 4 + 6 = 10\) (Invalid since \(b > c\))
   - If \(a = 5\), \(b = 24 - 2(5) = 14\), \(c = 5 + 6 = 11\) (Invalid since \(b > c\))
   - If \(a = 6\), \(b = 24 - 2(6) = 12\), \(c = 6 + 6 = 12\) (Valid)
   - If \(a = 7\), \(b = 24 - 2(7) = 10\), \(c = 7 + 6 = 13\) (Valid)
   - If \(a = 8\), \(b = 24 - 2(8) = 8\), \(c = 8 + 6 = 14\) (Valid)

   Valid distributions:
   - \(a = 6\), \(b = 12\), \(c = 12\)
   - \(a = 7\), \(b = 10\), \(c = 13\)
   - \(a = 8\), \(b = 8\), \(c = 14\)

### Optimal Strategy:
Bob should guess the minimum number of coins in each box to ensure he wins the maximum possible amount. Given the valid distributions, the minimum number of coins in any box is 6.

### Minimum Amount of Money:
If Bob guesses 6 coins for each box, he will win at least 6 coins from each box, regardless of the actual distribution. Therefore, the minimum amount of money Bob can win is:
\[
6 \times 3 \times \$1,000 = \$18,000
\]

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$18,000**.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: To convert the given symbols from the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system into Arabic numerals, we need to understand the value of each cuneiform symbol in the context of the Babylonian base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

The symbols provided are:
𒐜  𒐐𒐚

First, let's break down the symbols:

1. 𒐜: This symbol represents the number 1 in the Babylonian system.
2. 𒐐𒐚: This combination of symbols represents the number 59 in the Babylonian system.

In the Babylonian system, numbers are written in a positional notation similar to our decimal system, but with base 60 instead of base 10. Each position represents a power of 60.

Given the symbols:
- 𒐜 (1) is in the first position (units place).
- 𒐐𒐚 (59) is in the second position (60s place).

To convert this to a decimal number, we calculate the value of each position and sum them up:

- The value of 𒐐𒐚 (59) in the 60s place is \( 59 \times 60 = 3540 \).
- The value of 𒐜 (1) in the units place is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

Adding these values together:
\[ 3540 + 1 = 3541 \]

Therefore, the number represented by the symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚 in the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system is 3541 in Arabic numerals.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given and deduce the colors of the removed cube. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cube Types and Counts**:
   - 6 center cubes (one colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each)

2. **Found Cubes**:
   - All blue cubes are found.
   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube are found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corners are found.
   - All green cubes that border yellow are found.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces, meaning it is an edge cube.

### Analysis:

- **Blue Cubes**: Since all blue cubes are found, the removed cube cannot have blue on it.
- **Orange Center and Adjacent Cubes**: The orange center cube and its adjacent cubes (left, right, above, below) are found. This means the orange face and its immediate neighbors are accounted for.
- **Green Corners**: All green corners are found, so the removed cube cannot be a green corner.
- **Green Bordering Yellow**: All green cubes that border yellow are found, so the removed cube cannot be a green-yellow edge cube.
- **Opposite Faces of Orange Cubes**: For all found orange cubes, the opposite face’s cubes are found. This means if an orange cube is found, the cube directly opposite it on the Rubik's cube is also found.

### Deduction:

Since the removed cube is an edge cube and it cannot have blue, green, or orange on it (due to the conditions above), we need to consider the remaining colors: red, white, and yellow.

- **Red and White**: These colors are not mentioned in the constraints, so they are potential candidates.
- **Yellow**: Since all green cubes bordering yellow are found, the removed cube cannot be green-yellow. However, it can still be yellow with another color that is not green or blue.

Given the constraints, the only possible combination for the removed edge cube is **red and white**.

### Conclusion:

The removed cube has the colors **red** and **white**. Therefore, the answer is:

**red, white**)
