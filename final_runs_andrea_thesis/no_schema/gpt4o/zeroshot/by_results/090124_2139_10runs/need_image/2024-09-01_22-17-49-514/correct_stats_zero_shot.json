The Chinese zodiac consists of twelve animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. \n\nIn traditional Chinese art and iconography, these animals are often depicted in various forms, sometimes anthropomorphized (given human characteristics) and sometimes in their natural animal forms. If the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2015 featured anthropomorphized versions of these animals, it is possible that some of them might have been depicted with visible hands.\n\nHowever, without specific details from the exhibition, it is difficult to determine exactly how many of the twelve animals were depicted with visible hands. If you have access to images or descriptions from the exhibition, you could count the number of animals that are shown with hands. \n\nIf you can provide more details or excerpts from the documents, I might be able to give a more precise answer.",
