Row 19: Incorrect (Expected: Mapping Human Oriented Information to Software Agents for Online Systems Usage, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't access or view the attached documents. However, I can help you understand how to find the information you need. 

To determine the title of the first paper authored by the individual who had authored prior papers in the 2015 paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?", you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Authors**: Look at the list of authors for the 2015 paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?".

2. **Check Publication History**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers prior to 2015.

3. **Find the First Paper**: For the author who has prior publications, identify the earliest paper they authored.

You can use academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or the digital library of the conference/journal where the paper was published to look up the authors' publication histories.

If you provide the names of the authors, I can guide you on how to search for their publication history.)

Row 43: Incorrect (Expected: Guatemala, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't view or analyze the attached documents. However, I can guide you on how to find the information you need.

To identify the country of the unknown language article under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE as of 2020, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access BASE**: Go to the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) website.

2. **Search for DDC 633**: Use the search function to look for articles classified under Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) 633, which pertains to "Field and plantation crops."

3. **Filter by Year**: Apply a filter to show results from the year 2020.

4. **Identify Languages and Flags**: Look through the search results and identify the languages and corresponding flags of the articles.

5. **Find the Unique Flag**: Look for an article with a flag that is unique compared to the others. This flag will indicate the country of the unknown language article.

If you have access to the specific search results or a list of articles, you can manually check the flags and languages to find the unique one. If you need further assistance, please provide more details or context, and I'll do my best to help!)

Query with Attached Docs: In the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015, how many of the "twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac" have a hand visible?
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 163: Incorrect (Expected: 11, Got: I don't have access to the specific documents you attached, but I can provide some general information that might help you. The Chinese zodiac consists of twelve animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. 

Typically, in artistic representations, not all of these animals would have hands visible because many of them are not traditionally depicted with human-like hands. For example:

- Rat: May have paws visible.
- Ox: Typically depicted with hooves.
- Tiger: Paws.
- Rabbit: Paws.
- Dragon: Claws.
- Snake: No hands.
- Horse: Hooves.
- Goat: Hooves.
- Monkey: Hands.
- Rooster: Wings/claws.
- Dog: Paws.
- Pig: Hooves.

From this list, the Monkey is the most likely to be depicted with hands. The Dragon might also be depicted with claws that could be considered hand-like. However, without specific details from the exhibition, it's challenging to provide an exact number. If the exhibition featured anthropomorphized versions of these animals, more of them might have been depicted with hands. 

For a precise answer, you would need to refer to the specific details or images from the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition.)
