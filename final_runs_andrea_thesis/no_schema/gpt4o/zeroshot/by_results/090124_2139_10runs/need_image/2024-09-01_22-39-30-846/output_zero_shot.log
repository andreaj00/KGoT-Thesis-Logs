The Chinese zodiac consists of twelve animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. \n\nTypically, in artistic representations, not all of these animals would have hands visible because many of them are not traditionally depicted with human-like hands. For example:\n\n- Rat: May have paws visible.\n- Ox: Typically depicted with hooves.\n- Tiger: Paws.\n- Rabbit: Paws.\n- Dragon: Claws.\n- Snake: No hands.\n- Horse: Hooves.\n- Goat: Hooves.\n- Monkey: Hands.\n- Rooster: Wings/claws.\n- Dog: Paws.\n- Pig: Hooves.\n\nFrom this list, the Monkey is the most likely to be depicted with hands. The Dragon might also be depicted with claws that could be considered hand-like. However, without specific details from the exhibition, it's challenging to provide an exact number. If the exhibition featured anthropomorphized versions of these animals, more of them might have been depicted with hands. \n\nFor a precise answer, you would need to refer to the specific details or images from the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition." response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 266, 'prompt_tokens': 54, 'total_tokens': 320}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-ef93b827-1e28-4c27-9c54-6c75119b529c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 54, 'output_tokens': 266, 'total_tokens': 320}
