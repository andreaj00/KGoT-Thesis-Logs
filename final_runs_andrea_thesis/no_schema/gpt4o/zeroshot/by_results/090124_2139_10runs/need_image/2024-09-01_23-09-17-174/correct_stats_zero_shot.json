However, I can help you understand how to find the information you need. \n\nTo determine the title of the first paper authored by the individual who had authored prior papers in the 2015 paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\", you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Authors**: Look at the list of authors for the 2015 paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\".\n\n2. **Check Publication History**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers prior to 2015. This can be done using academic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, or the digital library of the conference/journal where the paper was published.\n\n3. **Find the First Paper**: Once you identify the author(s) with prior publications, look for the earliest paper they authored. This will be their first paper.\n\nIf you provide the names of the authors, I can guide you on how to search for their publication history.",
