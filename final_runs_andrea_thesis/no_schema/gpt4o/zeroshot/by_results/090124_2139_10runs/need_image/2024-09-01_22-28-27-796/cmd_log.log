Row 19: Incorrect (Expected: Mapping Human Oriented Information to Software Agents for Online Systems Usage, Got: I don't have access to the specific document you attached, so I can't directly reference the authors or their previous works. However, I can guide you on how to find this information.

1. **Identify the Authors**: Look at the list of authors for the paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?" from 2015.

2. **Check for Prior Publications**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers before 2015.

3. **Find the First Paper**: For the author who has prior publications, identify the earliest paper they authored.

You can use academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or the digital library of the conference/journal where the paper was published to track the publication history of the authors.

If you provide the names of the authors, I can help you further with the steps to find their first paper.)

To determine the country of the unknown language article under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE as of 2020, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine):** Go to the BASE website.

2. **Search for DDC 633:** Use the search function to look for articles classified under DDC 633, which pertains to "Field and plantation crops."

3. **Filter by Year:** Apply a filter to show only articles from the year 2020.

4. **Identify the Unique Flag:** Look through the list of articles and their associated metadata. Pay attention to the flags representing the countries of origin for each article. Identify the flag that is unique compared to the others.

5. **Determine the Country:** Once you have identified the unique flag, you can determine the country it represents.

If you have access to the specific database or list, you can manually check each entry to find the one with the unique flag. If you need further assistance, please provide more context or details, and I'll do my best to help!)

Row 163: Incorrect (Expected: 11, Got: To determine how many of the "twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac" have a hand visible in the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015, we need to identify the animals and check for the presence of hands. The twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac are:

1. Rat
2. Ox
3. Tiger
4. Rabbit
5. Dragon
6. Snake
7. Horse
8. Goat
9. Monkey
10. Rooster
11. Dog
12. Pig

Let's consider each animal:

1. **Rat**: Typically depicted with paws, not hands.
2. **Ox**: Typically depicted with hooves, not hands.
3. **Tiger**: Typically depicted with paws, not hands.
4. **Rabbit**: Typically depicted with paws, not hands.
5. **Dragon**: Often depicted with claws, which can be considered as hands in some artistic representations.
6. **Snake**: Typically depicted without limbs.
7. **Horse**: Typically depicted with hooves, not hands.
8. **Goat**: Typically depicted with hooves, not hands.
9. **Monkey**: Typically depicted with hands.
10. **Rooster**: Typically depicted with wings, not hands.
11. **Dog**: Typically depicted with paws, not hands.
12. **Pig**: Typically depicted with hooves, not hands.

From this analysis, the animals that can be considered to have hands are:

- Dragon (if claws are considered hands)
- Monkey

Therefore, **two** of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac have a hand visible.)
