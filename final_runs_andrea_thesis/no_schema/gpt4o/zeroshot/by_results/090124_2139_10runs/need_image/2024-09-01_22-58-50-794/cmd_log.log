Row 19: Incorrect (Expected: Mapping Human Oriented Information to Software Agents for Online Systems Usage, Got: I don't have access to the specific document you attached, so I can't directly reference the authors or their previous works. However, I can guide you on how to find this information.

1. **Identify the Authors**: Look at the list of authors for the paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?" from 2015.

2. **Check for Prior Publications**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers before 2015.

3. **Find the First Paper**: For the author who has prior publications, identify the earliest paper they authored.

You can use academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or the digital library of the conference/journal where the paper was published to track the publication history of the authors.

If you provide the names of the authors, I can help you further with the steps to find their first paper.)

Row 43: Incorrect (Expected: Guatemala, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't view or analyze attached documents. However, I can guide you on how to find the information you need.

To identify the country of the unknown language article under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE as of 2020, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access BASE**: Go to the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) website.

2. **Search for DDC 633**: Use the search function to look for articles classified under DDC 633, which pertains to "Field & plantation crops."

3. **Filter by Year**: Apply a filter to show only articles from the year 2020.

4. **Identify Languages and Flags**: Look through the search results and identify the languages and corresponding flags of the articles.

5. **Find the Unique Flag**: Compare the flags to identify the one that is unique from the others. This flag will indicate the country of the unknown language article.

If you have access to the specific search results or a list of articles, you can manually check each one to find the unique flag. If you need further assistance, please provide more details or context, and I'll do my best to help!)

Query with Attached Docs: In the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015, how many of the "twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac" have a hand visible?
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 163: Incorrect (Expected: 11, Got: To determine how many of the "twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac" have a hand visible in the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition, we need to refer to the specific details provided in the attached documents. However, since I cannot directly view the attached documents, I will provide a general approach based on common knowledge of the Chinese zodiac and typical exhibition practices.

The twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac are:
1. Rat
2. Ox
3. Tiger
4. Rabbit
5. Dragon
6. Snake
7. Horse
8. Goat
9. Monkey
10. Rooster
11. Dog
12. Pig

Typically, in artistic representations, the following animals might be depicted with hands (or hand-like appendages):
- Monkey
- Dragon (sometimes depicted with claws that can be considered hand-like)
- Rat (occasionally depicted with hand-like front paws)

The other animals are less likely to be depicted with hands in traditional representations.

To answer the question accurately, you would need to review the specific artworks from the exhibition to see how each animal is depicted. If the exhibition followed traditional representations, you might expect to see hands or hand-like appendages on the Monkey, Dragon, and possibly the Rat.

If you have access to the exhibition catalog or images from the exhibition, you can count the number of animals with visible hands directly from those sources.)
