However, since I cannot directly view the attached documents, I will provide a general approach based on common knowledge of the Chinese zodiac and typical exhibition practices.\n\nThe twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac are:\n1. Rat\n2. Ox\n3. Tiger\n4. Rabbit\n5. Dragon\n6. Snake\n7. Horse\n8. Goat\n9. Monkey\n10. Rooster\n11. Dog\n12. Pig\n\nTypically, in artistic representations, the following animals might be depicted with hands (or hand-like appendages):\n- Monkey\n- Dragon (sometimes depicted with claws that can be considered hand-like)\n- Rat (occasionally depicted with hand-like front paws)\n\nThe other animals are less likely to be depicted with hands in traditional representations.\n\nTo answer the question accurately, you would need to review the specific artworks from the exhibition to see how each animal is depicted. If the exhibition followed traditional representations, you might expect to see hands or hand-like appendages on the Monkey, Dragon, and possibly the Rat.\n\nIf you have access to the exhibition catalog or images from the exhibition, you can count the number of animals with visible hands directly from those sources.",
