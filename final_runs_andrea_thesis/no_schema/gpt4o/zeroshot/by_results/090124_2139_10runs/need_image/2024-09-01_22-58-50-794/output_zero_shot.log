If the exhibition followed traditional representations, you might expect to see hands or hand-like appendages on the Monkey, Dragon, and possibly the Rat.\n\nIf you have access to the exhibition catalog or images from the exhibition, you can count the number of animals with visible hands directly from those sources.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 280, 'prompt_tokens': 54, 'total_tokens': 334}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-125e3f30-3cc0-4f7b-9ac6-fada3e04484e-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 54, 'output_tokens': 280, 'total_tokens': 334}
