However, I can guide you on how to find this information.\n\n1. **Identify the Authors**: First, list out the authors of the paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?" from 2015.\n\n2. **Check Prior Publications**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers prior to 2015.\n\n3. **Find the First Paper**: Identify the earliest paper authored by the author who has prior publications.\n\nYou can use academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or the ACM Digital Library to look up the publication history of each author. Here’s a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Google Scholar**:\n   - Go to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).\n   - Enter the name of each author in the search bar.\n   - Look through their list of publications to find the earliest one.\n\n2. **Institutional Repositories**:\n   - If the authors are affiliated with academic institutions, check the institutions\' repositories or personal academic pages.\n\n3. **ResearchGate**:\n   - Search for the authors on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), which often lists publications and their dates.\n\n4. **ACM Digital Library**:\n   - If the paper is related to computer science, the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/) is a good resource to check the authors\' publication history.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to determine the title of the first paper authored by the author who had prior publications.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 362, 'prompt_tokens': 65, 'total_tokens': 427}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-5a55260c-e3cd-4dcf-af97-2d05bef58e9a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 65, 'output_tokens': 362, 'total_tokens': 427}
