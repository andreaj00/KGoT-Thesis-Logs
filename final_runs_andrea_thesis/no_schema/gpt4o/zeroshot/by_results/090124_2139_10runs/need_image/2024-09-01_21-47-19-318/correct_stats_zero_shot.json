However, I can guide you on how to find this information.\n\n1. **Identify the Authors**: First, list all the authors of the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" from 2015.\n\n2. **Check Publication Histories**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers prior to 2015. This can be done using academic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, or the ACM Digital Library.\n\n3. **Find the First Paper**: Once you identify an author who has prior publications, look for their earliest paper. The title of this paper will be the answer you are looking for.\n\nIf you provide the names of the authors, I can help you with a more detailed search strategy or guide you on how to use specific databases to find their publication histories.",

However, I can help you understand how to find the information you need. \n\nTo determine the country of the unknown language article under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE as of 2020, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access BASE**: Go to the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) website.\n\n2. **Search for DDC 633**: Use the search function to look for articles classified under Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) 633, which pertains to \"Field and plantation crops.\"\n\n3. **Filter by Year**: Apply a filter to show only articles from the year 2020.\n\n4. **Identify Languages and Flags**: Look through the search results to identify the languages of the articles. Each article should have a flag indicating the country of origin or the language used.\n\n5. **Find the Unique Flag**: Compare the flags to identify the one that is unique or different from the others. This flag will indicate the country of the unknown language article.\n\nIf you have access to the specific search results or a list of articles, you can manually check each one to find the unique flag. If you need further assistance, please provide more details or context, and I'll do my best to help!",

The Chinese zodiac consists of twelve animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. \n\nTypically, in artistic representations, not all of these animals would have hands visible, as many of them are not anthropomorphized in traditional Chinese art. For example:\n\n- Rat: May have paws visible.\n- Ox: Generally depicted with hooves.\n- Tiger: Paws.\n- Rabbit: Paws.\n- Dragon: Claws.\n- Snake: No hands.\n- Horse: Hooves.\n- Goat: Hooves.\n- Monkey: Hands.\n- Rooster: Wings/claws.\n- Dog: Paws.\n- Pig: Hooves.\n\nBased on this, the animals that might be depicted with hands (or hand-like appendages) are the Rat (paws), Monkey (hands), and Dragon (claws). However, the exact number and depiction can vary depending on the artistic interpretation in the exhibition.\n\nTo get the precise number of animals with visible hands in the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition, you would need to refer to the specific details or images from that exhibition.",
