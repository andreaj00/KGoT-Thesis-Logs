Row 114: Incorrect (Expected: 4, Got: The phrase that appears thirty seconds into the first episode of the Game Grumps' Let's Play of Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) is "THIS IS A NIGHTMARE."

To determine how many times the letter "E" appears in this phrase, let's count:

- "THIS" has no "E".
- "IS" has no "E".
- "A" has no "E".
- "NIGHTMARE" has one "E".

So, the letter "E" appears **once** in the phrase "THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.")

Row 164: Incorrect (Expected: 1:41.614, Got: To provide the world record time for the specific track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023, I would need to know the exact racetrack the GameGrumps were competing on at the two-minute mark of their video uploaded on May 14, 2017.

However, you can find the most up-to-date world record times for each track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe by visiting dedicated speedrunning websites or leaderboards such as those on the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe section of the "Mario Kart World Records" website or the "Speedrun.com" website. These platforms maintain current records and can provide the precise times for each track.)
