Row 114: Incorrect (Expected: 4, Got: The phrase that appears thirty seconds into the first episode of the Game Grumps' Let's Play of Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) is "THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO DIE." 

To determine how many times the letter "E" appears in this phrase, let's count:

- "THIS" has no E's.
- "GAME" has one E.
- "MAKES" has one E.
- "ME" has one E.
- "WANT" has no E's.
- "TO" has no E's.
- "DIE" has one E.

Adding them up, we get:

1 (from "GAME") + 1 (from "MAKES") + 1 (from "ME") + 1 (from "DIE") = 4

So, the letter "E" appears 4 times in the phrase "THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO DIE.")

Row 164: Incorrect (Expected: 1:41.614, Got: To find the world record time for the specific track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023, you would need to identify the track being played at the two-minute mark in the GameGrumps video uploaded on May 14, 2017. Once the track is identified, you can look up the world record time for that track.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Identify the Track**: Watch the GameGrumps video and note the track they are racing on at the two-minute mark.
2. **Look Up the World Record**: Visit a reliable source for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe world records, such as the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe section on the website "mkwrs.com" (Mario Kart World Records) or other reputable leaderboards.

Since I don't have the ability to watch the video or access external websites directly, I can guide you on how to do it:

- **Watch the Video**: Go to the GameGrumps YouTube channel and find the video uploaded on May 14, 2017, where they play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Skip to the two-minute mark to see which track they are racing on.
- **Check the World Record**: Once you know the track, go to a site like "mkwrs.com" and find the 150cc world record for that specific track as of June 7, 2023.

For example, if the track at the two-minute mark is "Rainbow Road," you would look up the 150cc world record for Rainbow Road on the specified date.

If you provide the name of the track, I can help you find the specific world record time.)
