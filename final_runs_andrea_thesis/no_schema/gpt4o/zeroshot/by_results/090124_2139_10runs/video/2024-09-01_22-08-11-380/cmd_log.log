To determine how many times the letter "E" appears in this phrase, let's count the occurrences:

Row 164: Incorrect (Expected: 1:41.614, Got: To find the world record time for the specific track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023, you would need to identify the track being played at the two-minute mark in the GameGrumps video uploaded on May 14, 2017. Once the track is identified, you can look up the world record time for that track.

However, since I don't have access to the video or the specific track information, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Identify the Track**: Watch the GameGrumps video and note the track they are playing at the two-minute mark.

2. **Check World Records**: Visit a reliable source for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe world records, such as the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe section on the website "mkwrs.com" (Mario Kart World Records) or other reputable leaderboards.

3. **Find the Record**: Look up the world record for the identified track in the 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.

For example, if the track is "Rainbow Road," you would search for the 150cc world record for Rainbow Road as of the specified date.

Since I can't perform these steps directly, you would need to follow them to get the exact world record time. If you provide the name of the track, I can help you look up the record time.)
