Row 164: Incorrect (Expected: 1:41.614, Got: To find the world record time for the specific track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023, you would typically need to refer to a reliable source such as the official Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leaderboards or a dedicated speedrunning community like those on Speedrun.com.

However, since I don't have access to external databases or the ability to browse the internet in real-time, I can't provide the exact world record time. Instead, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Visit Speedrun.com**: This is a popular website for tracking speedrun records across various games, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
2. **Search for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**: Use the search function to find the game.
3. **Navigate to the 150cc Category**: Look for the specific category that includes 150cc races.
4. **Find the Track**: Locate the specific track you are interested in. The track name should be mentioned in the GameGrumps video or you can identify it based on the visual cues from the video.
5. **Check the Leaderboard**: The leaderboard will display the world record times for each track.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to find the most up-to-date world record time for the track in question.)
