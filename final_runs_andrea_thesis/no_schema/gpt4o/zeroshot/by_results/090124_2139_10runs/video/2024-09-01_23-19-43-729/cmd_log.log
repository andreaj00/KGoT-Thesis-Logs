Row 114: Incorrect (Expected: 4, Got: The phrase that appears thirty seconds into the first episode of the Game Grumps' Let's Play of Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) is "THIS IS A NIGHTMARE." 

To determine how many times the letter "E" appears in this phrase, let's count the occurrences:

- T H I S   I S   A   N I G H T M A R E

The letter "E" appears once in the word "NIGHTMARE."

Therefore, the letter "E" appears **1** time in the phrase "THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.")

Row 164: Incorrect (Expected: 1:41.614, Got: To find the world record time for the specific track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023, you would typically need to consult a reliable source such as the official Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leaderboards or a dedicated speedrunning community like those on Speedrun.com.

However, since I don't have access to external databases or the ability to browse the internet in real-time, I can't provide the exact world record time directly. Instead, I can guide you on how to find this information:

1. **Visit Speedrun.com**: This is a popular site for tracking world records in various games, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
2. **Search for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**: Use the search function to find the game.
3. **Navigate to the 150cc Leaderboards**: Look for the specific category for 150cc races.
4. **Find the Track**: Locate the specific track you are interested in.
5. **Check the Record**: The world record time will be listed along with the player who achieved it.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to find the most up-to-date world record time for the track in question.)
