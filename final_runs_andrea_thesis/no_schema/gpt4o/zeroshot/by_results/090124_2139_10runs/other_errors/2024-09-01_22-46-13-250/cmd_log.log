Row 42: Incorrect (Expected: Harbinger, Tidal, Got: To determine which albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole prior to 1999 did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau, we need to look at their discographies up to that point and cross-reference with Christgau's reviews.

**Fiona Apple:**
1. *Tidal* (1996)

**Paula Cole:**
1. *Harbinger* (1994)
2. *This Fire* (1996)

Now, let's check Robert Christgau's reviews for these albums:

- Fiona Apple's *Tidal* received a letter grade from Robert Christgau.
- Paula Cole's *This Fire* received a letter grade from Robert Christgau.
- Paula Cole's *Harbinger* did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau.

Therefore, the album that did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau is:

**Harbinger**

So, the answer is:

**Harbinger**)



Solving question 56:

Row 56: Incorrect (Expected: 6, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't view the attached documents. However, I can help you understand how to find the information you need.

To determine how many of the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies of 2020 are also in the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies, you would need to:

1. Obtain the list of the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies of 2020 from Box Office Mojo.
2. Obtain the list of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic (U.S. and Canada) movies of 2020 from Box Office Mojo.
3. Compare the two lists and count how many movies appear in both lists.

If you can provide the lists or the names of the movies, I can help you compare them. Alternatively, you can visit Box Office Mojo's website and look up the lists for 2020 to perform the comparison yourself.)



Solving question 70:
Query: Find the value of x to the nearest tenth: Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4-thousand'n'ninety-7 minus C
Where L is the last two digits of the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence,
A is the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white,
and C is the height of the average woman in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter

Row 70: Incorrect (Expected: 563.9, Got: To solve for \( x \) in the given equation, we need to determine the values of \( L \), \( A \), and \( C \) first.

1. **Determine \( L \)**:
   - The Venezuelan Declaration of Independence was signed on July 5, 1811.
   - The last two digits of 1811 are 11.
   - Therefore, \( L = 11 \).

2. **Determine \( A \)**:
   - As of July 2023, the TikTok logo has three colors excluding black and white: red, blue, and cyan.
   - Therefore, \( A = 3 \).

3. **Determine \( C \)**:
   - According to a July 2023 Business Insider article, the average height of a woman in the Philippines is 150 cm.
   - Therefore, \( C = 150 \).

Now, substitute these values into the equation:

\[ Lx = \left( \frac{d}{dx} (A \cdot x^2) \right) + 4097 - C \]

First, compute the derivative:

\[ \frac{d}{dx} (A \cdot x^2) = \frac{d}{dx} (3 \cdot x^2) = 6x \]

Substitute the values into the equation:

\[ 11x = 6x + 4097 - 150 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 11x = 6x + 3947 \]

Subtract \( 6x \) from both sides:

\[ 5x = 3947 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3947}{5} = 789.4 \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) to the nearest tenth is \( 789.4 \).)



Solving question 99:
Query: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

Row 99: Incorrect (Expected: broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes, Got: Sure, I can help with that. Here is the list of vegetables from your grocery list, alphabetized and in a comma-separated format:

bell pepper, broccoli, celery, corn, green beans, lettuce, sweet potatoes, zucchini

Note that some items commonly thought of as vegetables, like bell peppers and sweet potatoes, are botanically fruits, but they are often categorized as vegetables in culinary contexts. However, since your mom is a botany professor, I've made sure to include only those items that are typically considered vegetables in both culinary and botanical contexts.)
