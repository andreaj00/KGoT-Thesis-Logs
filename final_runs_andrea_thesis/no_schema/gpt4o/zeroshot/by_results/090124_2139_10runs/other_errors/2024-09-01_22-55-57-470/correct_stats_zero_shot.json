Visit Box Office Mojo's website.\n2. Look up the 2020 Worldwide Box Office list to identify the top 10 highest-grossing movies globally.\n3. Look up the 2020 Domestic Box Office list to identify the top 10 highest-grossing movies in the U.S. and Canada.\n4. Compare the two lists and count how many movies appear in both the worldwide and domestic top 10 lists.\n\nIf you provide the lists or specific titles, I can help you compare them directly.",
