Unfortunately, I don't have access to the attached documents, but I can guide you on how to find the answer.\n\n1. **Access Box Office Mojo's 2020 Worldwide Box Office list**: This list will show you the top 10 highest-grossing movies worldwide for the year 2020.\n\n2. **Access Box Office Mojo's 2020 Domestic Box Office list**: This list will show you the top 10 highest-grossing movies domestically (in the United States) for the year 2020.\n\n3. **Compare the two lists**: Identify which movies appear on both lists.\n\nFor example, if the worldwide list includes movies like \"Bad Boys for Life,\" \"1917,\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" and the domestic list also includes these movies, you would count how many of these movies are common to both lists.\n\nSince I don't have the actual lists, I can't provide the exact number, but you can follow these steps to find the answer. If you provide the lists, I can help you compare them directly.",
