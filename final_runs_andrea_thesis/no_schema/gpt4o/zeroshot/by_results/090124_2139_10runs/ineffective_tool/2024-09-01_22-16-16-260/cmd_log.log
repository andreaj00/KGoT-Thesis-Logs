Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.

3. **Check for Loops**: Determine if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that starting from any green cell, Earl can visit all other green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell.

4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to revisit any green cell once he has left it, except for the final return to the starting cell.

Since I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, I'll describe the general approach you can take:

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Map the Green Cells**:
   - Create a list or a matrix to represent the green cells' positions.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Treat each green cell as a node in a graph.
   - Create edges between nodes that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use DFS or BFS to check if all green cells are connected.
   - If any green cell is not reachable from another green cell, then Earl cannot traverse all plots without stepping on non-green cells.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Use DFS to detect if there is a cycle in the graph formed by the green cells.
   - A cycle in this context means that Earl can start at one green cell, visit all other green cells exactly once, and return to the starting cell.

5. **Eulerian Circuit**:
   - Check if the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a path that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting point).
   - For an Eulerian circuit to exist, every vertex (green cell) must have an even degree (an even number of edges).

### Example Analysis

Let's assume a simple 3x3 grid where the green cells are as follows:

```
G G G
G W G
G G G
```

- G represents a green cell (owned by Earl).
- W represents a white cell (not owned by Earl).

1. **Identify Green Cells**:
   - All cells except the center cell (1,1) are green.

2. **Check Connectivity**:
   - All green cells are connected.

3. **Check for Loops**:
   - Earl can start at any green cell, traverse all green cells, and return to the starting cell.

4. **No Backtracking**:
   - Earl can traverse the green cells in a loop without revisiting any cell.

In this example, Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking.

### Conclusion

To definitively answer the question for your specific spreadsheet, you would need to apply the above steps to the actual data. If the green cells form a single, continuous loop and are all connected, then Earl can indeed walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking.)

Solving question 85:
Query: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to apply Newton's Method iteratively until the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \).

Newton's Method formula is given by:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \]

First, we need to find the derivative of \( f(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = -5 \):

1. **Iteration 1:**
   \[ x_0 = -5 \]
   \[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
   \[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

2. **Iteration 2:**
   \[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
   \[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \approx -0.0986 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \approx 30.1406 \]
   \[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{-0.0986}{30.1406} \approx -4.9375 + 0.0033 = -4.9342 \]

3. **Iteration 3:**
   \[ x_2 = -4.9342 \]
   \[ f(x_2) \approx -0.0003 \]
   \[ f'(x_2) \approx 30.0842 \]
   \[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} = -4.9342 - \frac{-0.0003}{30.0842} \approx -4.9342 + 0.00001 = -4.9342 \]

After the third iteration, the difference between \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) is less than \( 0.0001 \). Therefore, the smallest \( n \) where the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \) is \( n = 3 \).)

Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: Sure, I can help you decrypt the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. 

To decrypt the message, we need to know the shift value. Since you didn't provide the shift value, I'll try the most common shift value, which is 3 (as used by Julius Caesar).

Let's decrypt the message "Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk" by shifting each letter 3 places back in the alphabet:

- Z -> W
- s -> p
- m -> j
- x -> u
- s -> p

Row 91: Incorrect (Expected: 12, Got: I don't have access to external documents, including the one you attached. However, I can provide information based on my knowledge up to 2021.

As of 2021, the Asian countries that have a monarchy and access to the sea are:

1. **Thailand** - A constitutional monarchy with access to the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea.
2. **Japan** - A constitutional monarchy with extensive coastlines along the Pacific Ocean.
3. **Malaysia** - A federal constitutional monarchy with coastlines along the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.
4. **Bahrain** - A constitutional monarchy with access to the Persian Gulf.
5. **Oman** - An absolute monarchy with coastlines along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman.
6. **Saudi Arabia** - An absolute monarchy with coastlines along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.
7. **Jordan** - A constitutional monarchy with a small coastline along the Gulf of Aqaba.

These countries have both a monarchical system of government and access to the sea.)

Row 94: Incorrect (Expected: F478A7, Got: To determine the 6-digit hex code of the color of the cell where you land after moving on the eleventh turn, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Movement Rules**:
   - You start at the START cell.
   - You move exactly two cells per turn.
   - You can move up, down, left, or right.
   - You cannot move onto blue cells.
   - You cannot move backward.

2. **Determine the Path**:
   - Since the exact layout of the map is not provided, we need to assume a generic grid and avoid blue cells.
   - We need to count the number of moves and ensure we are moving exactly two cells per turn.

3. **Calculate the Position After 11 Turns**:
   - Each turn moves you two cells.
   - After 11 turns, you will have moved \(11 \times 2 = 22\) cells from the START position.

4. **Identify the Color of the Cell**:
   - The color of the cell where you land after 22 cells needs to be identified.
   - Since the map is not provided, we cannot determine the exact cell or its color.

Given the lack of specific map details, we cannot definitively determine the 6-digit hex code of the color of the cell where you land after the eleventh turn. If you provide the actual map or more details about the layout and colors of the cells, I can help you find the exact hex code.)

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code attempts to generate a random integer between -100 and 100 and checks if it is zero. If it is zero, it returns the value; otherwise, it continues to generate new random integers until it finds zero. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `UhOh`: A custom exception class.
   - `Hmm`: A class with an `__init__` method that initializes `self.value` to a random integer between -100 and 100. It also has a method `Yeah` that returns `True` if `self.value` is zero, otherwise raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay`: A generator function that yields instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - `keep_trying`: A function that takes a generator `go` and a boolean `first_try`. It attempts to get a `Hmm` instance from the generator and checks if its value is zero using the `Yeah` method. If the value is zero, it returns the value. If not, it catches the `UhOh` exception, prints messages on the first try, waits for 0.1 seconds, and then recursively calls itself.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - The `main` block initializes the generator `go` and prints the result of `keep_trying(go)`.

The code will keep generating random integers until it finds zero. The final numeric output will always be `0` because the function `keep_trying` only returns when `maybe.value` is zero.

Here is the relevant part of the code that ensures this:

```python
if maybe.Yeah():
    return maybe.value
```

Since `Yeah` only returns `True` when `self.value` is zero, the function will only return zero.

Therefore, the final numeric output from the attached Python code is:

```
0
```)
