Solving question 36:

Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking?

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.

3. **Check for Loops**: Determine if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that Earl can start at any green cell, visit all other green cells exactly once, and return to the starting cell.

4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to revisit any green cell once he has left it.

Since I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, I'll describe the process in more detail:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify Green Cells**:
   - Go through the spreadsheet and note down the coordinates of all green cells.

2. **Check Connectivity**:
   - Use a graph traversal algorithm (like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) to check if all green cells are connected. If any green cell is isolated, Earl cannot traverse all green cells in a single path.

3. **Check for Loops**:
   - If the green cells are connected, check if they form a loop. This can be done by ensuring that each green cell has exactly two neighbors (except for the start and end cells in a path, which should have one neighbor each if it's not a loop).

4. **No Backtracking**:
   - Ensure that the traversal path does not require Earl to revisit any green cell. This can be checked by ensuring that the path forms a Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex).

### Example Analysis

Let's consider a hypothetical example:

```
A B C D E
1 . G . G .
2 G G G . .
3 . G . . .
4 . . . . .
5 . . . . .
```

- Green cells: (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2)
- Check connectivity: All green cells are connected.
- Check for loops: 
  - (1,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (1,4) -> (3,2) -> (1,2)
  - This forms a loop.
- No backtracking: Earl can traverse all green cells without revisiting any cell.

In this example, Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking.

### Conclusion

To definitively answer the question for your specific spreadsheet, you would need to perform the above steps on the actual data. If the green cells form a single, continuous loop without requiring Earl to revisit any cell, then the answer is yes, Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If not, the answer is no.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to apply Newton's Method iteratively until the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \).

Newton's Method formula is given by:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \]

First, we need to find the derivative of \( f(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = -5 \):

1. **Iteration 1:**
   \[ x_0 = -5 \]
   \[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
   \[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

2. **Iteration 2:**
   \[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
   \[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \]
   \[ f(x_1) \approx -120.4746 + 97.65625 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.00015 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) \approx 73.125 + 39.5 - 3 = 32.625 \]
   \[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{0.00015}{32.625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0000046 \approx -4.9375046 \]

3. **Iteration 3:**
   \[ x_2 = -4.9375046 \]
   \[ f(x_2) \approx (-4.9375046)^3 + 4(-4.9375046)^2 - 3(-4.9375046) + 8 \]
   \[ f(x_2) \approx -120.4746 + 97.65625 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.0000001 \]
   \[ f'(x_2) = 3(-4.9375046)^2 + 8(-4.9375046) - 3 \]
   \[ f'(x_2) \approx 73.125 + 39.5 - 3 = 32.625 \]
   \[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} = -4.9375046 - \frac{0.0000001}{32.625} \approx -4.9375046 - 0.000000003 \approx -4.937504603 \]

After rounding to four decimal places, we see that \( x_2 \approx -4.9375 \) and \( x_3 \approx -4.9375 \). Therefore, the smallest \( n \) where the values are the same after rounding to four decimal places is \( n = 2 \).)

Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: Sure, I can help you decrypt the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

To decrypt the message, we need to know the shift value. Since you didn't provide the shift value, I'll try the most common shift value, which is 3 (as used by Julius Caesar).

Let's shift each letter in the message 3 places back in the alphabet:

- Z -> W
- s -> p
- m -> j
- x -> u
- s -> p
- m -> j

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Wpjpjp".

- k -> g
- j -> f

So, "sx" becomes "fk".

- Z -> M

Since the document provided does not include the actual map or the color codes, I will outline the steps you need to take to solve this problem:

1. **Identify the START and END cells**: Locate the START cell on your Excel map.

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code generates a random integer between -100 and 100 and keeps trying until it gets a value of 0. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. **Class Definitions and Imports**:
   - `UhOh` is a custom exception class.
   - `Hmm` is a class with an `__init__` method that initializes an instance with a random integer (`self.value`) between -100 and 100.
   - The `Yeah` method of `Hmm` checks if `self.value` is 0. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay` is a generator function that yields instances of `Hmm`.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - `keep_trying` is a recursive function that keeps trying to get a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0.
   - It uses the generator `go` to get the next `Hmm` instance.
   - If `Yeah` returns `True`, it returns the value (which would be 0).
   - If `Yeah` raises an `UhOh` exception, it prints "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." on the first try, then waits for 0.1 seconds before recursively calling itself.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - The `main` block initializes the generator `go` and calls `keep_trying(go)`, printing the result.

Given that the code keeps trying until it gets a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0, the final numeric output will always be `0`.

Here is the relevant part of the code that ensures this:

```python
def keep_trying(go, first_try=True):
    maybe = next(go)
    try:
        if maybe.Yeah():
            return maybe.value
    except UhOh:
        if first_try:
            print("Working...")
            print("Please wait patiently...")
        time.sleep(0.1)
        return keep_trying(go, first_try=False)
```

The function `keep_trying` will keep calling itself until `maybe.value` is 0, at which point `maybe.Yeah()` will return `True`, and `maybe.value` (which is 0) will be returned and printed.

Therefore, the final numeric output from the attached Python code is `0`.)
