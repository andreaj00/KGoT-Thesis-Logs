Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the connectivity and layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet. The key is to check if the green cells form a single, continuous path that allows Earl to traverse each plot exactly once and return to the starting point, forming a Hamiltonian cycle.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.

3. **Form a Cycle**: Determine if there is a way to visit each green cell exactly once and return to the starting cell. This is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph formed by the green cells.

4. **Avoid Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not revisit any green cell once it has been left, except for the final return to the starting cell.

Since I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, I'll provide a general approach you can use to determine the answer:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the green cells as nodes in a graph.
   - Draw edges between nodes that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).

2. **Check for Hamiltonian Cycle**:
   - Use algorithms or manual inspection to check if there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. Algorithms like backtracking, dynamic programming, or heuristic methods can be used.

3. **Manual Inspection**:
   - Start from any green cell and try to trace a path that visits each green cell exactly once and returns to the starting cell.
   - Ensure that no cell is revisited except for the final return to the starting cell.

### Example:

If the green cells form a simple shape like a rectangle or a line, it might be easier to manually check for a Hamiltonian cycle. For more complex shapes, algorithmic approaches might be necessary.

### Conclusion:

If you can find such a path that visits each green cell exactly once and returns to the starting cell without revisiting any cell (except the final return), then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If no such path exists, then it is not possible for Earl to do so.

Without the actual spreadsheet, I can't provide a definitive answer, but you can follow the steps above to analyze the layout of the green cells and determine the answer.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to apply Newton's Method iteratively until the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \).

Newton's Method formula is given by:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \]

First, we need to find the derivative of \( f(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = -5 \):

1. **Iteration 1:**
   \[ x_0 = -5 \]
   \[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
   \[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

2. **Iteration 2:**
   \[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
   \[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \approx -120.4746 + 97.6563 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.0002 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.625 \]
   \[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{0.0002}{30.625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0000065 = -4.9375065 \]

3. **Iteration 3:**
   \[ x_2 = -4.9375065 \]
   \[ f(x_2) \approx 0 \] (since \( f(x_1) \approx 0 \) and the change is very small)
   \[ f'(x_2) \approx 30.625 \] (since \( f'(x_1) \approx 30.625 \) and the change is very small)
   \[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} \approx -4.9375065 \]

Since the difference between \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) is less than \( 0.0001 \), we can stop here.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) where the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \) is \( n = 2 \).)

Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: Sure, I can help you decrypt the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. 

To decrypt the message, we need to know the shift value. Since you didn't provide the shift value, I'll try the most common shift value, which is 3 (as used by Julius Caesar himself).

Let's decrypt the message "Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk" by shifting each letter 3 places back in the alphabet:

- Z -> W
- s -> p
- m -> j
- x -> u
- s -> p
- m -> j

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Wpjpjp".

- s -> p
- c -> z

So, "sc" becomes "pz".

- s -> p
- x -> u

So, "sx" becomes "pu".

- Z -> W
- y -> v
- v -> s
- i -> f
- l -> i
- s -> p
- e -> b
- c -> z

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Wvfsipbz".

- Z -> W
- v -> s
- k -> h
- j -> g
- k -> h

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Wshgh".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Wpjpjp pz pu Wvfsipbz Wshgh."

This doesn't seem to make sense, so let's try a different shift value. 

Let's try a shift of 4:

- Z -> V
- s -> o
- m -> i
- x -> t
- s -> o
- m -> i

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Voitio".

- s -> o
- c -> y

So, "sc" becomes "oy".

- s -> o
- x -> t

So, "sx" becomes "ot".

- Z -> V
- y -> u
- v -> r
- i -> e
- l -> h
- s -> o
- e -> a
- c -> y

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Vurehoay".

- Z -> V
- v -> r
- k -> g
- j -> f
- k -> g

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Vrgfg".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Voitio oy ot Vurehoay Vrgfg."

This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's try a shift of 1:

- Z -> Y
- s -> r
- m -> l
- x -> w
- s -> r
- m -> l

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Yrlwrl".

- s -> r
- c -> b

So, "sc" becomes "rb".

- s -> r
- x -> w

So, "sx" becomes "rw".

- Z -> Y
- y -> x
- v -> u
- i -> h
- l -> k
- s -> r
- e -> d
- c -> b

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Yxuhkrdb".

- Z -> Y
- v -> u
- k -> j
- j -> i
- k -> j

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Yujij".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Yrlwrl rb rw Yxuhkrdb Yujij."

This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's try a shift of 25 (which is equivalent to shifting 1 place forward):

- Z -> A
- s -> t
- m -> n
- x -> y
- s -> t
- m -> n

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Atnytn".

- s -> t
- c -> d

So, "sc" becomes "td".

- s -> t
- x -> y

So, "sx" becomes "ty".

- Z -> A
- y -> z
- v -> w
- i -> j
- l -> m
- s -> t
- e -> f
- c -> d

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Azwjmtfd".

- Z -> A
- v -> w
- k -> l
- j -> k
- k -> l

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Awlkl".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Atnytn td ty Azwjmtfd Awlkl."

This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's try a shift of 2:

- Z -> X
- s -> q
- m -> k
- x -> v
- s -> q
- m -> k

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Xqkqkq".

- s -> q
- c -> a

So, "sc" becomes "qa".

- s -> q
- x -> v

So, "sx" becomes "qv".

- Z -> X
- y -> w
- v -> t
- i -> g
- l -> j
- s -> q
- e -> c
- c -> a

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Xwtgjqca".

- Z -> X
- v -> t
- k -> i
- j -> h
- k -> i

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Xtihi".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Xqkqkq qa qv Xwtgjqca Xtihi."

This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's try a shift of 5:

- Z -> U
- s -> n
- m -> h
- x -> s
- s -> n
- m -> h

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Unhnun".

- s -> n
- c -> x

So, "sc" becomes "nx".

- s -> n
- x -> s

So, "sx" becomes "ns".

- Z -> U
- y -> t
- v -> q
- i -> d
- l -> g
- s -> n
- e -> z
- c -> x

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Utqdgnzx".

- Z -> U
- v -> q
- k -> f
- j -> e
- k -> f

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Uqfef".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Unhnun nx ns Utqdgnzx Uqfef."

This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's try a shift of 6:

- Z -> T
- s -> m
- m -> g
- x -> r
- s -> m
- m -> g

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Tmgrmg".

- s -> m
- c -> w

So, "sc" becomes "mw".

- s -> m
- x -> r

So, "sx" becomes "mr".

- Z -> T
- y -> s
- v -> p
- i -> c
- l -> f
- s -> m
- e -> y
- c -> w

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Tspcfmyw".

- Z -> T
- v -> p
- k -> e
- j -> d
- k -> e

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Tpedf".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Tmgrmg mw mr Tspcfmyw Tpedf."

This still doesn't make sense. 

Let's try a shift of 7:

- Z -> S
- s -> l
- m -> f
- x -> q
- s -> l
- m -> f

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Slfqlf".

- s -> l
- c -> v

So, "sx" becomes "lq".

- Z -> S
- y -> r

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Sodcd".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

- s -> k
- m -> e

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Rkepke".

So, "sx" becomes "kp".

- Z -> R

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code generates a random integer between -100 and 100 and keeps trying to find a value of 0. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Class Definitions and Imports:**
   - `UhOh` is a custom exception class.
   - `Hmm` is a class that initializes with a random integer value between -100 and 100.
   - The `Yeah` method of `Hmm` checks if the value is 0. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function:**
   - `Okay` is a generator function that yields instances of `Hmm`.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - `keep_trying` is a recursive function that keeps trying to get a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0.
   - If the value is not 0, it catches the `UhOh` exception, prints "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." on the first try, waits for 0.1 seconds, and then calls itself recursively.

4. **Main Execution:**
   - The `main` block initializes the generator `go` and prints the result of `keep_trying(go)`.

The code will keep generating new `Hmm` instances until it finds one with a value of 0. When it does, it will return and print that value.

Since the value is randomly generated, the final numeric output will always be `0` because the function only returns when it finds a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0. The number of iterations and the time it takes can vary, but the output will always be:

```
0
```

Additionally, during the process, you might see the following printed to the console if it doesn't find 0 on the first try:

```
Working...
Please wait patiently...
```

These messages will only appear once, regardless of how many attempts it takes to find a `0`.)
