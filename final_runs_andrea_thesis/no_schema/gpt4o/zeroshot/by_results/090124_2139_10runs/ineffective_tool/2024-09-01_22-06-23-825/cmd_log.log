Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.

3. **Check for Loops**: Verify if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that starting from any green cell, Earl can visit all other green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell.

4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to revisit any green cell once he has left it.

To illustrate, let's assume the spreadsheet looks like this (G represents green cells, and other letters represent other owners):

```
A B G G
A G G B
A G B B
A G G G
```

1. **Identify Green Cells**:
   - (1,3), (1,4)
   - (2,2), (2,3)
   - (3,2)
   - (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

2. **Check Connectivity**:
   - (1,3) is connected to (1,4)
   - (1,4) is connected to (2,3)
   - (2,3) is connected to (2,2)
   - (2,2) is connected to (3,2)
   - (3,2) is connected to (4,2)
   - (4,2) is connected to (4,3)
   - (4,3) is connected to (4,4)

3. **Check for Loops**:
   - Starting from (1,3), Earl can move to (1,4), then to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,3), then to (4,4), and finally back to (1,3) through a valid path without revisiting any cell.

4. **No Backtracking**:
   - The path described above does not require Earl to revisit any green cell.

Based on this analysis, if the green cells form a similar pattern in your spreadsheet, Earl can indeed walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If the green cells do not form a continuous loop or if there are isolated green cells, then it would not be possible for Earl to achieve this.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to apply Newton's Method iteratively until the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \).

Newton's Method formula is given by:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \]

First, we need to find the derivative of \( f(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = -5 \):

1. **Iteration 1:**
   \[ x_0 = -5 \]
   \[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
   \[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

2. **Iteration 2:**
   \[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
   \[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \approx -120.5039 + 97.7539 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.0625 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.625 \]
   \[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{0.0625}{30.625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0020 = -4.9395 \]

3. **Iteration 3:**
   \[ x_2 = -4.9395 \]
   \[ f(x_2) \approx (-4.9395)^3 + 4(-4.9395)^2 - 3(-4.9395) + 8 \approx -120.5039 + 97.7539 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.0001 \]
   \[ f'(x_2) \approx 3(-4.9395)^2 + 8(-4.9395) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.625 \]
   \[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} = -4.9395 - \frac{0.0001}{30.625} \approx -4.9395 - 0.000003 = -4.9395 \]

Since the difference between \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) is less than \( 0.0001 \), we stop here.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) where the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \) is \( n = 2 \).)

Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: Sure, I can help you decrypt the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. 

To decrypt the message, we need to know the shift value. Since you didn't provide the shift value, I'll try the most common shift value, which is 3 (as used by Julius Caesar).

Let's decrypt the message "Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk" by shifting each letter 3 places back in the alphabet:

- Z -> W
- s -> p
- m -> j
- x -> u
- s -> p
- m -> j

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Wpjpjp".

- s -> p
- c -> z

So, "sc" becomes "pz".

- s -> p
- x -> u

So, "sx" becomes "pu".

- Z -> W
- y -> v
- v -> s
- i -> f
- l -> i
- s -> p
- e -> b
- c -> z

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Wvfsipbz".

- Z -> W
- v -> s
- k -> h
- j -> g
- k -> h

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Wshgh".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Wpjpjp pz pu Wvfsipbz Wshgh."

This doesn't seem to make sense, so let's try another common shift value, which is 1:

- Z -> Y
- s -> r
- m -> l
- x -> w
- s -> r
- m -> l

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Yrlwrl".

- s -> r
- c -> b

So, "sc" becomes "rb".

- s -> r
- x -> w

So, "sx" becomes "rw".

- Z -> Y
- y -> x
- v -> u
- i -> h
- l -> k
- s -> r
- e -> d
- c -> b

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Yxuhkrdb".

- Z -> Y
- v -> u
- k -> j
- j -> i
- k -> j

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Yujij".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Yrlwrl rb rw Yxuhkrdb Yujij."

This also doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 4:

- Z -> V
- s -> o
- m -> i
- x -> t
- s -> o
- m -> i

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Voitio".

- s -> o
- c -> y

So, "sc" becomes "oy".

- s -> o
- x -> t

So, "sx" becomes "ot".

- Z -> V
- y -> u
- v -> r
- i -> e
- l -> h
- s -> o
- e -> a
- c -> y

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Vurehoay".

- Z -> V
- v -> r
- k -> g
- j -> f
- k -> g

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Vrgfg".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Voitio oy ot Vurehoay Vrgfg."

This also doesn't seem to make sense. 

Given that the common shifts don't seem to work, it might be a different shift value. Let's try a shift of 5:

- Z -> U
- s -> n
- m -> h
- x -> s
- s -> n
- m -> h

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Unhnh".

- s -> n
- c -> x

So, "sc" becomes "nx".

- s -> n
- x -> s

So, "sx" becomes "ns".

- Z -> U
- y -> t
- v -> q
- i -> d
- l -> g
- s -> n
- e -> z
- c -> x

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Utqgndzx".

- Z -> U
- v -> q
- k -> f
- j -> e
- k -> f

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Uqfef".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Unhnh nx ns Utqgndzx Uqfef."

This also doesn't seem to make sense. 

Given that the common shifts don't seem to work, it might be a different shift value. Let's try a shift of 13, which is also common:

- Z -> M
- s -> f
- m -> z
- x -> k
- s -> f
- m -> z

So, "Zsmxsm" becomes "Mfzkfz".

- s -> f

So, "sc" becomes "fp".

- x -> k

So, "sx" becomes "fk".

- Z -> M
- y -> l
- v -> i
- i -> v
- l -> y
- s -> f
- e -> r

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Mlvyfrp".

- v -> i
- k -> x
- j -> w
- k -> x

- s -> t

So, "sx" becomes "ty".

- Z -> A
- y -> z
- v -> w

- s -> t
- e -> f
- c -> d

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Azwjmtfd".

- Z -> A
- v -> w
- k -> l
- j -> k
- k -> l

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Awkl".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Atntyn td ty Azwjmtfd Awkl."

This also doesn't seem to make sense.

So, "Zyvilsec" becomes "Mlvyfrp".

- Z -> M
- v -> i
- k -> x
- j -> w
- k -> x

So, "Zvkjk" becomes "Mixwx".

Putting it all together, the decrypted message is:

"Mfzkfz fp fk Mlvyfrp Mixwx."

This also doesn't seem to make sense. 

Given that the common shifts don't seem to work, it might be a different shift value. Let's try a shift of )

Solving question 94:
Query: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?

START

END
</doc>
</attached_docs>
Row 94: Incorrect (Expected: F478A7, Got: To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules and constraints given:

1. Start at the START cell.
2. Move exactly two cells per turn.
3. Move up, down, left, or right.
4. Avoid blue cells.
5. Do not move backward.
6. Determine the color of the cell you land on after the 11th turn.

Since the document provided does not include the actual map or the color codes, I will outline the steps you need to take to solve this problem:

1. **Identify the START and END cells**: Locate the START cell on your Excel map.
2. **Plan your path**: Determine a path from the START cell to the END cell, ensuring that each move is exactly two cells and avoids blue cells.
3. **Count the moves**: Track each move to ensure you are following the rules and count up to the 11th move.
4. **Check the color**: Once you land on the cell after the 11th move, check the color of that cell.

Since I don't have the actual map or the color codes, I can't provide the exact hex code. However, you can follow these steps on your Excel file to find the answer.

If you provide the map or more details about the layout and colors, I can give more specific guidance.)

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code generates a random integer between -100 and 100 and keeps trying until it gets a value of 0. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Imports and Class Definitions:**
   - `randint` from the `random` module is used to generate random integers.
   - `time` module is used to introduce a delay.
   - `UhOh` is a custom exception class.
   - `Hmm` is a class that initializes with a random integer (`self.value`) and has a method `Yeah` that returns `True` if `self.value` is 0, otherwise raises an `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function:**
   - `Okay` is a generator function that yields instances of `Hmm`.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - `keep_trying` is a recursive function that keeps trying to get a `Hmm` instance with `self.value` equal to 0.
   - If `maybe.Yeah()` returns `True` (i.e., `self.value` is 0), it returns `maybe.value`.
   - If an `UhOh` exception is raised, it prints "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." on the first try, then waits for 0.1 seconds before recursively calling itself.

4. **Main Execution:**
   - The `main` block initializes the generator `go` and prints the result of `keep_trying(go)`.

Given that the code keeps trying until it gets a `Hmm` instance with `self.value` equal to 0, the final numeric output will always be `0`.

Therefore, the final numeric output from the attached Python code is:

```
0
