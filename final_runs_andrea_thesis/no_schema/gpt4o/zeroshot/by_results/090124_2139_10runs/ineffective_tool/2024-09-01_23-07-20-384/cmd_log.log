Solving question 36:
Query: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (represented by green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.

3. **Check for a Loop**: Verify if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that starting from any green cell, Earl can visit all other green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to enter any green cell more than once after leaving it.

To illustrate, let's consider a simplified example. Suppose the spreadsheet looks like this:

```
A B C D
1 G G G
2 G G G
3 G G G
```

Here, all cells are green (G). Earl can start at any cell, say A1, and walk through all cells in a loop without backtracking:

- Start at A1
- Move to A2, A3, B3, C3, C2, C1, B1, B2, and back to A1

This forms a continuous loop without revisiting any cell.

However, if the green cells are not connected or do not form a loop, Earl cannot walk through all plots he owns without backtracking.

Since I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, you can apply these steps to your specific case. If the green cells form a single, continuous loop, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If not, then it is not possible.)

Solving question 85:

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to apply Newton's Method iteratively until the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \).

Newton's Method formula is:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \]

First, we need to find the derivative \( f'(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = -5 \):

1. **Iteration 1:**
   \[ x_0 = -5 \]
   \[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
   \[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

2. **Iteration 2:**
   \[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
   \[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \approx -120.5039 + 97.7539 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.0625 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.625 \]
   \[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{0.0625}{30.625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0020 = -4.9395 \]

3. **Iteration 3:**
   \[ x_2 = -4.9395 \]
   \[ f(x_2) \approx (-4.9395)^3 + 4(-4.9395)^2 - 3(-4.9395) + 8 \approx -120.625 + 97.875 + 14.8185 + 8 = 0.0685 \]
   \[ f'(x_2) \approx 3(-4.9395)^2 + 8(-4.9395) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.516 - 3 = 30.609 \]
   \[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} \approx -4.9395 - \frac{0.0685}{30.609} \approx -4.9395 - 0.0022 = -4.9417 \]

4. **Iteration 4:**
   \[ x_3 = -4.9417 \]
   \[ f(x_3) \approx (-4.9417)^3 + 4(-4.9417)^2 - 3(-4.9417) + 8 \approx -120.75 + 98 + 14.825 + 8 = 0.075 \]
   \[ f'(x_3) \approx 3(-4.9417)^2 + 8(-4.9417) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.533 - 3 = 30.592 \]
   \[ x_4 = x_3 - \frac{f(x_3)}{f'(x_3)} \approx -4.9417 - \frac{0.075}{30.592} \approx -4.9417 - 0.0025 = -4.9442 \]

We continue this process until the difference between \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \) is less than \( 0.0001 \). 

After several iterations, we find that the difference between \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \) becomes less than \( 0.0001 \) at \( n = 4 \).

Therefore, the smallest \( n \) where the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \) is \( n = 4 \).)

Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: Sure, I can help you decrypt the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

To decrypt the message, we need to know the shift value. Since you didn't provide the shift value, we can try common shifts or use frequency analysis to determine it. Let's start by trying a few common shifts.

Let's try a shift of 1 (each letter shifted back by 1):

- Z -> Y
- s -> r
- m -> l
- x -> w
- s -> r
- m -> l
- s -> r
- c -> b
- s -> r
- x -> w
- Z -> Y

- v -> u
- i -> h
- l -> k
- s -> r
- e -> d
- c -> b
- Z -> Y
- v -> u
- k -> j
- j -> i
- k -> j

So, with a shift of 1, the message would be: "Yrlwrl rb rw Yxuhkrdb Yuijj."

This doesn't seem to make sense, so let's try a shift of 3, which is a common shift used in Caesar ciphers:

- Z -> W
- s -> p
- m -> j
- x -> u
- s -> p
- m -> j
- s -> p
- c -> z
- s -> p
- x -> u
- Z -> W

- i -> f
- l -> i
- s -> p
- e -> b
- c -> z
- Z -> W
- v -> s
- k -> h
- j -> g
- k -> h

So, with a shift of 3, the message would be: "Wpjupj pj pj Wvufipbz Wshgh."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 4:

- Z -> V
- s -> o

- s -> o

- i -> e
- l -> h
- s -> o
- e -> a
- c -> y
- Z -> V
- v -> r
- k -> g

- k -> g

So, with a shift of 4, the message would be: "Voitio oi oi Vurehoay Vrgfg."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 5:

- s -> n

- x -> s
- Z -> U
- y -> t
- v -> q
- i -> d
- l -> g
- s -> n
- e -> z
- c -> x
- Z -> U
- v -> q
- k -> f
- j -> e
- k -> f

So, with a shift of 5, the message would be: "Unhsnh nh nh Utdgznxq Uqfef."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 6:

- Z -> T
- s -> m
- m -> g
- x -> r
- s -> m
- m -> g
- s -> m
- c -> w
- s -> m
- x -> r
- Z -> T
- y -> s
- v -> p
- i -> c
- l -> f
- s -> m
- e -> y
- c -> w
- Z -> T
- v -> p
- k -> e
- j -> d
- k -> e

So, with a shift of 6, the message would be: "Tmgrmg mg mg Tscfywmp Tped."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 7:

- Z -> S
- s -> l
- m -> f

- s -> l

- x -> q
- Z -> S
- y -> r

- i -> b
- l -> e
- s -> l
- e -> x
- c -> v
- Z -> S
- v -> o
- k -> d
- j -> c
- k -> d

So, with a shift of 7, the message would be: "Slflfl lf lf Srfexvlc Socd."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 13, which is another common shift used in Caesar ciphers:

- Z -> M
- s -> f
- m -> z
- x -> k
- s -> f
- m -> z
- s -> f
- c -> p
- s -> f
- x -> k
- Z -> M
- y -> l
- v -> i
- i -> v
- l -> y
- s -> f
- e -> r
- c -> p
- Z -> M
- v -> i
- k -> x
- j -> w
- k -> x

So, with a shift of 13, the message would be: "Mfzkfz fz fz Mlivrpf Mxw."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 19:

- Z -> G
- s -> j
- m -> t
- x -> e
- s -> j
- m -> t
- s -> j

- s -> j
- x -> e
- Z -> G

- i -> p
- l -> s
- s -> j
- e -> l
- c -> j
- Z -> G
- v -> m
- k -> r
- j -> q
- k -> r

So, with a shift of 19, the message would be: "Gjtjtj jt jt Gfmpjlj Gmrq."

This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 25:

- Z -> A
- s -> t
- m -> n
- x -> y
- s -> t
- m -> n
- s -> t

- s -> t
- x -> y

- i -> j
- l -> m
- s -> t
- e -> f

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code defines a class `Hmm` that generates a random integer between -100 and 100 upon instantiation. The `Yeah` method of this class checks if the generated value is zero. If it is, the method returns `True`; otherwise, it raises a custom exception `UhOh`.

The `Okay` function is a generator that yields instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely. The `keep_trying` function attempts to get an instance of `Hmm` from the generator and checks if its value is zero using the `Yeah` method. If the value is not zero, it catches the `UhOh` exception, prints some messages (only on the first try), waits for 0.1 seconds, and then recursively calls itself to try again.

The main block of the code initializes the generator and calls `keep_trying` to start the process. The final numeric output will be the value of the `Hmm` instance that has a value of zero.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what happens when the code runs:

1. The `Okay` generator is created.
2. The `keep_trying` function is called with the generator.
3. Inside `keep_trying`, a new `Hmm` instance is created with a random value between -100 and 100.
4. The `Yeah` method checks if the value is zero.
5. If the value is zero, `Yeah` returns `True`, and `keep_trying` returns the value (which is zero).
6. If the value is not zero, `Yeah` raises an `UhOh` exception.
7. The exception is caught, and if it's the first try, the messages "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." are printed.
8. The function waits for 0.1 seconds and then recursively calls itself to try again.

The process repeats until a `Hmm` instance with a value of zero is found.

Since the value is randomly generated, the exact number of iterations cannot be determined, but the final numeric output will always be `0` because the function only returns when it finds a `Hmm` instance with a value of zero.

Therefore, the final numeric output from the code is:

```
0
