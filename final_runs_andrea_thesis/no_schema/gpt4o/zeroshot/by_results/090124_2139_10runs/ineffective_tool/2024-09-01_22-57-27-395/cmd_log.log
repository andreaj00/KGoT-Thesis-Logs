Solving question 36:
Query: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking?

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (represented by green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.

3. **Check for a Loop**: Verify if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that starting from any green cell, Earl can visit all other green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to enter any green cell more than once after leaving it.

To illustrate, let's consider a simplified example. Suppose the spreadsheet looks like this:

```
A B C D
1 G G G
2 G G G
3 G G G
```

Here, all cells are green (G). Earl can start at any cell, say A1, and walk through all cells in a loop without backtracking:

- Start at A1
- Move to A2, A3, B3, C3, C2, C1, B1, B2, and back to A1

This forms a continuous loop without revisiting any cell.

However, if the green cells are not connected or do not form a loop, Earl cannot walk through all plots he owns without backtracking.

Since I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, you can apply these steps to your specific case. If the green cells form a single, continuous loop, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If not, then it is not possible.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to follow the iterative process of Newton's Method. Newton's Method is given by the formula:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
- \( x_0 = -5 \)
- \( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \)

First, we need to compute the derivative of \( f(x) \):

\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Now, we will apply Newton's Method iteratively until the value of \( x_n \) converges to four decimal places.

### Iteration 0:
\[ x_0 = -5 \]

### Iteration 1:
\[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
\[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
\[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

### Iteration 2:
\[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
\[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \approx -1.1899 \]
\[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \approx 30.1406 \]
\[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{-1.1899}{30.1406} \approx -4.9375 + 0.0395 = -4.8980 \]

### Iteration 3:
\[ x_2 = -4.8980 \]
\[ f(x_2) = (-4.8980)^3 + 4(-4.8980)^2 - 3(-4.8980) + 8 \approx -0.0116 \]
\[ f'(x_2) = 3(-4.8980)^2 + 8(-4.8980) - 3 \approx 29.5684 \]
\[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} = -4.8980 - \frac{-0.0116}{29.5684} \approx -4.8980 + 0.0004 = -4.8976 \]

### Iteration 4:
\[ x_3 = -4.8976 \]
\[ f(x_3) = (-4.8976)^3 + 4(-4.8976)^2 - 3(-4.8976) + 8 \approx -0.0000 \]
\[ f'(x_3) = 3(-4.8976)^2 + 8(-4.8976) - 3 \approx 29.5625 \]
\[ x_4 = x_3 - \frac{f(x_3)}{f'(x_3)} = -4.8976 - \frac{-0.0000}{29.5625} \approx -4.8976 \]

After rounding to four decimal places, \( x_3 \) and \( x_4 \) are the same. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) where the value converges to four decimal places is \( n = 3 \).)

Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: Sure, I'd be happy to help you decrypt the message! The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

To decrypt the message, we need to know the shift value. Since you didn't provide the shift value, we can try to decrypt it by testing common shift values. 

Let's start by shifting each letter back by 4 positions, which is a common shift value for Caesar ciphers:

- Z -> V
- s -> o
- m -> i
- x -> t
- s -> o
- m -> i
- s -> o
- c -> y
- s -> o
- x -> t
- Z -> V
- y -> u
- v -> r
- i -> e
- l -> h
- s -> o
- e -> a
- c -> y
- Z -> V
- v -> r
- k -> g
- j -> f
- k -> g

So, the decrypted message is:

"Vitoi oi ot Vurehoay Vrgfg."

This doesn't seem to make sense, so let's try another common shift value, such as 3:

- Z -> W
- s -> p
- m -> j
- x -> u
- s -> p
- m -> j
- s -> p
- c -> z
- s -> p
- x -> u
- Z -> W
- y -> v
- v -> s
- i -> f
- l -> i
- s -> p
- e -> b
- c -> z
- Z -> W
- v -> s
- k -> h
- j -> g
- k -> h

So, the decrypted message is:

"Wpjupj pj pu Wvfiopbz Wshgh."

- Z -> Y
- s -> r
- m -> l
- x -> w

- v -> u
- i -> h
- l -> k
- s -> r
- e -> d
- c -> b
- Z -> Y
- v -> u
- k -> j
- j -> i
- k -> j

So, the decrypted message is:

"Yrlwrj rj rj Yxuhkrdb Yujij."

This still doesn't seem right. Let's try shifting by 25 (which is equivalent to shifting by -1):

- Z -> A
- s -> t

- s -> t
- c -> d
- s -> t
- x -> y
- Z -> A
- y -> z
- v -> w
- i -> j
- l -> m
- s -> t
- e -> f
- c -> d
- Z -> A
- v -> w
- k -> l
- j -> k
- k -> l

So, the decrypted message is:

"Antynt tn tn Azwjmfed Awklk."

This still doesn't seem right. Let's try shifting by 13 (which is a common shift value for Caesar ciphers):

- Z -> M
- s -> f
- m -> z

- s -> f
- m -> z
- s -> f
- c -> p
- s -> f
- x -> k
- Z -> M
- y -> l

- i -> v
- l -> y
- s -> f
- e -> r
- c -> p
- Z -> M
- v -> i
- k -> x
- j -> w
- k -> x

So, the decrypted message is:

"Mfzfzf pf pf Mlivyrfp Mxiwx."

This still doesn't seem right. Let's try shifting by 2:

- i -> g
- l -> j
- s -> q
- e -> c
- c -> a
- Z -> X
- v -> t
- k -> i
- j -> h
- k -> i

"Xqkqkq qk qk Xwgtjca Xtihi."

- x -> s

- i -> c
- l -> f
- s -> m
- e -> y
- c -> w

- v -> p
- k -> e
- j -> d
- k -> e

"Tmgrmg mg mg Tsqcfyw Tpedf."

START

END
</doc>
</attached_docs>
Row 94: Incorrect (Expected: F478A7, Got: To determine the 6-digit hex code of the color of the cell where you land on the eleventh turn, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Movement Rules**: You can move two cells per turn in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). You cannot move fewer than two cells, and you cannot move backward. You must avoid blue cells.

2. **Map Layout**: Since the provided document only shows "START" and "END" without a detailed map, we need to assume a hypothetical map layout. For simplicity, let's assume a grid where "START" is at the top-left corner and "END" is at the bottom-right corner.

3. **Calculate the Path**: We need to calculate the path from "START" to "END" while adhering to the movement rules and avoiding blue cells. Since the exact layout is not provided, we will assume a straightforward path.

4. **Determine the Cell on the Eleventh Turn**: Since each turn moves you two cells, on the eleventh turn, you will have moved \(11 \times 2 = 22\) cells from the starting point.

5. **Identify the Color of the Cell**: Without the actual map, we cannot determine the exact color of the cell. However, if we had the map, we would count 22 cells from the "START" position, following the allowed movements, and then check the color of the cell where we land.

Since the document does not provide the actual map or the color details, we cannot definitively determine the 6-digit hex code of the color of the cell where you land on the eleventh turn. If you can provide the detailed map or more information about the layout and colors, I can help you find the exact hex code.)

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code generates a random integer between -100 and 100 and keeps trying to find a value of 0. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Imports and Class Definitions:**
   - `randint` from the `random` module is used to generate random integers.
   - `time` module is used to introduce a delay.
   - `UhOh` is a custom exception class.
   - `Hmm` is a class that initializes with a random integer value between -100 and 100. It has a method `Yeah` that returns `True` if the value is 0, otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function:**
   - `Okay` is a generator function that yields instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - `keep_trying` is a recursive function that keeps trying to get a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0.
   - If the value is not 0, it catches the `UhOh` exception, prints messages on the first try, waits for 0.1 seconds, and then calls itself recursively.

4. **Main Execution:**
   - The `main` block initializes the generator `go` and prints the result of `keep_trying(go)`.

The code will keep generating random numbers until it finds a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0. When it finds such an instance, it will return and print the value 0.

**Final Numeric Output:**
The final numeric output of the code will always be `0`, as the code is designed to keep trying until it finds a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0.)
