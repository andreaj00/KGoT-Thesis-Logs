Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Final Result: content="To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (represented by green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.\n\nHere are the steps to analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.\n\n2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.\n\n3. **Check for a Loop**: Verify if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that starting from any green cell, Earl can visit all other green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.\n\n4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to enter any green cell more than once after leaving it.\n\nTo illustrate, let's consider a simplified example. Suppose the spreadsheet looks like this:\n\n```\nA B C D\n1 G G G\n2 G G G\n3 G G G\n```\n\nHere, all cells are green (G). Earl can start at any cell, say A1, and walk through all cells in a loop without backtracking:\n\n- Start at A1\n- Move to A2, A3, B3, C3, C2, C1, B1, B2, and back to A1\n\nThis forms a continuous loop without revisiting any cell.\n\nHowever, if the green cells are not connected or do not form a loop, Earl cannot walk through all plots he owns without backtracking.\n\nSince I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, you can apply these steps to your specific case. If the green cells form a single, continuous loop, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If not, then it is not possible." response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 423, 'prompt_tokens': 106, 'total_tokens': 529}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-c2aad3c8-f51a-4c5f-8cbf-2ff5aa77ea4a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 106, 'output_tokens': 423, 'total_tokens': 529}

It has a method `Yeah` that returns `True` if the value is 0, otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.\n\n2. **Generator Function:**\n   - `Okay` is a generator function that yields instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.\n\n3. **Recursive Function:**\n   - `keep_trying` is a recursive function that keeps trying to get a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0.\n   - If the value is not 0, it catches the `UhOh` exception, prints messages on the first try, waits for 0.1 seconds, and then calls itself recursively.\n\n4. **Main Execution:**\n   - The `main` block initializes the generator `go` and prints the result of `keep_trying(go)`.\n\nThe code will keep generating random numbers until it finds a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0. When it finds such an instance, it will return and print the value 0.\n\n**Final Numeric Output:**\nThe final numeric output of the code will always be `0`, as the code is designed to keep trying until it finds a `Hmm` instance with a value of 0." response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 357, 'prompt_tokens': 201, 'total_tokens': 558}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_fde2829a40', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-bf31a29e-7f16-48b3-9a6e-dd7310ccfde1-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 201, 'output_tokens': 357, 'total_tokens': 558}
