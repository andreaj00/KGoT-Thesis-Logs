Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Final Result: content="To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop. This means that Earl should be able to traverse all green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.\n\nHere are the steps to analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.\n\n2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that all green cells are connected. This means that from any green cell, there should be a path to any other green cell using only green cells.\n\n3. **Check for Loops**: Determine if the green cells form a loop. A loop means that starting from any green cell, Earl can visit all other green cells exactly once and return to the starting cell.\n\n4. **No Backtracking**: Ensure that the path does not require Earl to revisit any green cell once he has left it.\n\nSince I don't have the actual spreadsheet to analyze, I'll describe the general approach you can take:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - Treat each green cell as a node in a graph.\n   - Draw edges between nodes that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).\n\n2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n   - Use DFS or BFS to check if all green cells are connected.\n   - If any green cell is not reachable from another green cell, then Earl cannot traverse all plots without backtracking.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Use DFS to detect if there is a cycle in the graph formed by the green cells.\n   - A cycle in this context means that there is a path that starts and ends at the same cell, visiting all other green cells exactly once.\n\n4. **Eulerian Circuit**:\n   - Check if the graph has an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit exists if and only if every vertex has an even degree (each green cell has an even number of adjacent green cells).\n\n### Example:\n\nConsider a simple 3x3 grid where the green cells form a loop:\n\n```\nG G G\nG W G\nG G G\n```\n\n- G represents green cells (owned by Earl).\n- W represents white cells (not owned by Earl).\n\nIn this case:\n- All green cells are connected.\n- Earl can start at any green cell, traverse all green cells exactly once, and return to the starting cell without backtracking.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo definitively answer the question, you need to apply the above steps to the specific layout of green cells in your spreadsheet. If the green cells form a single, continuous loop without requiring Earl to revisit any cell, then he can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking.
