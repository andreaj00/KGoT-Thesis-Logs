        "returned_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to understand the concept of the p-value and the significance level. A p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. Typically, a p-value threshold (alpha level) of 0.05 is used to determine statistical significance, meaning that there is a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (Type I error).\n\nGiven that the average p-value is 0.04, we can assume that each paper has a 4% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. This is the Type I error rate.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( N \\) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.\n- \\( p \\) as the probability of a Type I error, which is 0.04.\n\nThe expected number of incorrect papers (Type I errors) can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of incorrect papers} = N \\times p \\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, the final number of incorrect papers would be:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = \\lceil N \\times 0.04 \\rceil \\]\n\nWithout the exact number of articles \\( N \\), we can't compute the exact number of incorrect papers. However, if you provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we can plug that number into the formula to get the result.\n\nFor example, if Nature published 1000 articles in 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Expected number of incorrect papers} = 1000 \\times 0.04 = 40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = \\lceil 40 \\rceil = 40 \\]\n\nSo, if Nature published 1000 articles, approximately 40 of them would be expected to be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance.",

For example, you might try `label:Regression polynomial` or similar queries.\n\n5. **Sort by Oldest**: Once you have the filtered list, sort the issues by the oldest first. This can typically be done by clicking on the sorting options and selecting \"Oldest\".\n\n6. **Check Closed Issues**: Ensure that you are looking at closed issues. You can add `is:closed` to your search query to filter out only closed issues.\n\n7. **Review Issue Details**: Click on the oldest closed issue to view its details. Look for the timeline or history of the issue to see when the `Regression` label was added.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to the attached documents or the ability to browse the web in real-time, you would need to follow these steps on GitHub to find the specific date.

This information can typically be found on the USDA or relevant regulatory body\u2019s website or through historical records of standards updates.\n\n4. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - Use the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage of Superseded Items} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Superseded Items}}{\\text{Total Number of Items}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n### Example Calculation (Hypothetical):\n\nAssume you identified 20 items in total from the 1959 standards that fit the criteria.\n\n- If 15 of these items have been superseded by new versions since 1959, the calculation would be:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage of Superseded Items} = \\left( \\frac{15}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 75\\%\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, 75% of the standards would have been superseded by a new version.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWithout the specific data from the attached documents, I can't provide the exact percentage.

He was consecrated as the Archbishop of Canterbury on June 3, 1162.\n\nThe consecrators of Thomas Becket were:\n1. Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester\n2. Roger de Pont L'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Archbishop of York\n3. Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of Hereford (later Bishop of London)\n\nAmong these consecrators:\n- Henry of Blois never became pope.\n- Roger de Pont L'\u00c9v\u00eaque never became pope.\n- Gilbert Foliot never became pope.\n\nSince none of the consecrators became pope, the answer to the question is any of the three. However, if we are to choose one, we can name Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, as he was the principal consecrator.\n\nTherefore, the name of the consecrator who never became pope is **Henry of Blois**.",

However, I can provide some general information about how Connected Papers works and what might cause a node (or bubble) to be larger in their graph.\n\nConnected Papers is a tool used to visualize the academic literature around a specific paper. It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: A larger node often indicates a paper that has been cited many times. High citation counts suggest that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nFor the specific case of the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or a combination of these factors. If the paper represented by the largest bubble has been highly cited, is highly relevant to the topic, or is well-connected to other influential papers, it would appear larger on the graph.\n\nTo get a precise answer, you would need to look at the specific metrics and data used by Connected Papers for that graph.
