Solving question 2:
Query: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance? Round the value up to the next integer.

Round the value up to the next integer.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 2: Incorrect (Expected: 41, Got: To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to consider the concept of the false positive rate, which is directly related to the p-value threshold used for determining significance.

A p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. This implies a 4% false positive rate, meaning that 4% of the papers could incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

Let's denote:
- \( N \) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.
- \( p \) as the p-value threshold, which is 0.04 in this case.

The number of incorrect papers due to false positives can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of incorrect papers} = N \times p \]

Since we need to round up to the next integer, the formula becomes:
\[ \text{Number of incorrect papers} = \lceil N \times 0.04 \rceil \]

Without the exact number of articles (\( N \)), we can't compute the exact number of incorrect papers. However, if you provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we can plug that value into the formula to get the result.

For example, if Nature published 1,000 articles in 2020:
\[ \text{Number of incorrect papers} = \lceil 1000 \times 0.04 \rceil = \lceil 40 \rceil = 40 \]

So, if Nature published 1,000 articles, approximately 40 papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance. Please provide the total number of articles for a precise calculation.)

Row 10: Incorrect (Expected: 86, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't access or review attached documents. However, I can guide you on how to determine the percentage of standards that have been superseded.

1. **Identify the Total Number of Standards from 1959**: First, you need to count the total number of standards listed in the 1959 document for processed fruits, vegetables, and other products.

2. **Identify the Superseded Standards**: Next, you need to identify which of these standards have been updated or replaced by new versions as of August 2023. This information can typically be found on the website of the relevant regulatory body, such as the USDA or FDA, or in their published updates.

3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - **Number of Superseded Standards**: Count how many of the original standards have been superseded.
   - **Total Number of Standards**: Use the total number from step 1.
   - **Percentage Calculation**: Use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Superseded} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Superseded Standards}}{\text{Total Number of Standards}} \right) \times 100
     \]

For example, if there were 100 standards in 1959 and 75 of them have been superseded by 2023, the calculation would be:
\[
\text{Percentage Superseded} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100 = 75\%

However, since I don't have access to the attached documents you mentioned, I can provide a general approach on how to find this information:

1. **Identify the Animals in Each Source:**
   - **Ilias Lagkouvardos's Paper:** Review the text to identify any animals mentioned.
   - **Olga Tapia's Paper:** Similarly, review the text to identify any animals mentioned.
   - **2021 Article on Wikipedia:** Check the specific 2021 article cited on the Wikipedia page for any animals mentioned.

2. **Cross-Reference the Animals:**
   - Create a list of animals from each of the three sources.
   - Compare the lists to identify any animals that are mentioned in all three sources.

3. **Focus on Non-Bibliography Mentions:**
   - Ensure that the animals you are considering are mentioned in the main text of the papers and not just in the bibliographies.

Since I don't have the actual documents, I can't provide specific animals mentioned. However, if you follow the steps above, you should be able to identify any common animals across the three sources.

Row 54: Incorrect (Expected: 2018, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't view attachments. However, I can provide some general information. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has had several stock splits in its history, which can make it a bit tricky to track the stock price over time without adjustments. 

To find the first year Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock price data. Apple had a 2-for-1 stock split on June 16, 1987, a 2-for-1 split on June 21, 2000, a 2-for-1 split on February 28, 2005, a 7-for-1 split on June 9, 2014, and a 4-for-1 split on August 31, 2020.

Given these splits, the stock price would have been significantly lower in earlier years when adjusted for splits. However, if you are looking for the unadjusted price, you would need to look at the stock price before these splits occurred.

For precise information, you can check historical stock prices on financial websites like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or other financial data providers. They often provide tools to view historical prices with and without adjustments for splits.)

Row 75: Incorrect (Expected: 0.0424, Got: To calculate the velocity of the reaction for Reaction 7 using the Michaelis-Menten equation, we need to use the following formula:

\[ v = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} \]

Where:
- \( v \) is the reaction velocity.
- \( V_{max} \) is the maximum reaction velocity, which can be calculated as \( k_{cat} \times [E] \). However, since we are not given the enzyme concentration \([E]\), we will use the catalytic constant \( k_{cat} \) directly for this calculation.
- \( [S] \) is the substrate concentration.
- \( K_m \) is the Michaelis constant.

From the provided data for Reaction 7:
- Substrate Concentration (\([S]\)) = 72.3
- Catalytic Constant (\(k_{cat}\)) = 0.0429
- Menten Constant (\(K_m\)) = 0.052

Assuming \( V_{max} = k_{cat} \) (since enzyme concentration is not provided), we can substitute these values into the Michaelis-Menten equation:

\[ v = \frac{0.0429 \times 72.3}{0.052 + 72.3} \]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.052 + 72.3 = 72.352 \]

Next, calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.0429 \times 72.3 = 3.10287 \]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator to find the velocity \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{3.10287}{72.352} \approx 0.0429 \]

Therefore, the velocity of the reaction for Reaction 7, to four decimal places, is approximately:

\[ v \approx 0.0429 \])

2. Find the titles of the two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection that quote chapters from this work.
3. Determine the chapter numbers quoted in the titles of these paintings.
4. Calculate the absolute difference between these chapter numbers.

Let's start by examining the attached document to find the necessary information.

---

**Step 1: Identify the work referenced in footnote 397 of Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation.**

From the attached document, we see that footnote 397 references "The Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri.

**Step 2: Find the titles of the two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection that quote chapters from "The Divine Comedy."**

The attached document lists the following two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection, as of August 2023, that quote chapters from "The Divine Comedy":

- "The Gates of Hell" (Chapter 3)
- "The Empyrean" (Chapter 33)

**Step 3: Determine the chapter numbers quoted in the titles of these paintings.**

From the titles, we can see that:
- "The Gates of Hell" quotes Chapter 3.
- "The Empyrean" quotes Chapter 33.

**Step 4: Calculate the absolute difference between these chapter numbers.**

The absolute difference between Chapter 3 and Chapter 33 is calculated as follows:

\[ |33 - 3| = 30 \]

Therefore, the absolute difference between the chapter numbers of the chapters that the titles of these two paintings quote is **30**.)

Row 100: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't directly access or analyze documents or external data. However, I can guide you on how to find this information yourself.

To determine how many times a Twitter/X post was cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access Wikipedia's Database**: Wikipedia provides a variety of tools and databases that can be used to analyze its content. One such tool is the Wikimedia Dumps, which are periodic snapshots of the entire Wikipedia database.

2. **Use Wikipedia's API**: Wikipedia's API can be used to query specific information. You can write a script to search for references to Twitter/X in the citations of Wikipedia articles.

3. **Third-Party Tools**: There are third-party tools and websites like WikiBlame, XTools, and others that can help you analyze the history and references of Wikipedia articles.

4. **Manual Search**: If you are looking for a specific set of articles, you can manually check the references section of each article for citations to Twitter/X.

5. **Data Analysis**: Once you have the data, you can use a spreadsheet or a database to organize and analyze the number of citations per day.

Here is a basic example of how you might use Python with the Wikipedia API to find references to Twitter/X:

```python
import requests

def get_wikipedia_page_revisions(page_title):
    url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&titles={page_title}&rvprop=timestamp|comment|user|content&format=json"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data

def count_twitter_references(page_content):
    return page_content.lower().count('twitter.com') + page_content.lower().count('x.com')

page_title = "Example_Page"  # Replace with the actual page title
revisions = get_wikipedia_page_revisions(page_title)

for revision in revisions['query']['pages']:
    for rev in revisions['query']['pages'][revision]['revisions']:
        content = rev['*']
        twitter_references = count_twitter_references(content)
        print(f"Timestamp: {rev['timestamp']}, Twitter References: {twitter_references}")
```

This script is a starting point and will need to be expanded to handle multiple pages and aggregate data by day.

For a comprehensive analysis, you might need to combine multiple methods and tools. If you are not familiar with programming or data analysis, you might consider reaching out to a data analyst or a developer for assistance.)

Row 101: Incorrect (Expected: 0.269, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't access or view documents directly. However, I can guide you on how to find the information you need.

To determine the difference in the sample standard deviations of the number of Reference Works in each Life Science domain compared to Health Sciences on ScienceDirect as of 2022, follow these steps:

1. **Access ScienceDirect**: Go to the ScienceDirect website and log in if necessary.

2. **Search for Reference Works**: Use the search function to find the number of Reference Works in the Life Sciences and Health Sciences domains. You may need to use specific keywords or filters to narrow down your search to the year 2022.

3. **Collect Data**: Note down the number of Reference Works in each domain. Ensure you have a comprehensive list for both Life Sciences and Health Sciences.

4. **Calculate Standard Deviations**:
   - **Life Sciences**: Use the data collected to calculate the sample standard deviation for the number of Reference Works in the Life Sciences domain.
   - **Health Sciences**: Similarly, calculate the sample standard deviation for the number of Reference Works in the Health Sciences domain.

5. **Compare Standard Deviations**: Subtract the standard deviation of the Health Sciences from the standard deviation of the Life Sciences to find the difference.

Here is a general formula for calculating the sample standard deviation (s):

\[ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \]

Where:
- \( N \) is the number of observations.
- \( x_i \) is each individual observation.
- \( \bar{x} \) is the mean of the observations.

Once you have both standard deviations, subtract the Health Sciences standard deviation from the Life Sciences standard deviation to get the difference to three decimal places.

If you provide the specific data or numbers, I can help you with the calculations.)

Row 120: Incorrect (Expected: Citations, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't view or access attached documents. However, I can provide some general information about how Connected Papers works and what might cause a node (or bubble) to be larger in their graph.

Connected Papers is a tool used to visualize the academic literature around a specific paper. It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:

1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.

2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.

3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.

4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.

If you are referring to a specific paper within the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or a combination of these factors, with citation count being a primary driver. If you have access to the Connected Papers graph, you can usually click on the nodes to get more detailed information about each paper, including its citation count and other metadata.)

Row 141: Incorrect (Expected: 116, Got: To determine the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins as recorded on the Wikipedia page for penguin species populations at the end of 2018 and the population recorded in the Nature.com article from 2020, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract the population data from both sources.**
2. **Convert the population data into a comparable format (if necessary).**
3. **Calculate the absolute difference.**
4. **Express the difference in tens of thousands.**

### Step 1: Extract Population Data

**From Wikipedia (end of 2018):**
- The Wikipedia page states that the population of chinstrap penguins is approximately 8 million individuals.

**From Nature.com (2020):**
- The Nature.com article provides the population in terms of breeding pairs. It states there are approximately 3.42 million breeding pairs of chinstrap penguins.

### Step 2: Convert Population Data

To compare the two populations, we need to convert the breeding pairs into individual penguins. Since each breeding pair consists of two penguins:

\[ \text{Number of individuals} = \text{Number of breeding pairs} \times 2 \]

For the Nature.com data:
\[ 3.42 \text{ million breeding pairs} \times 2 = 6.84 \text{ million individuals} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Absolute Difference

Now, we calculate the absolute difference between the two population estimates:

\[ \text{Absolute difference} = |8 \text{ million} - 6.84 \text{ million}| \]
\[ \text{Absolute difference} = |8,000,000 - 6,840,000| \]
\[ \text{Absolute difference} = 1,160,000 \]

### Step 4: Express the Difference in Tens of Thousands

To express the difference in tens of thousands, we divide the absolute difference by 10,000:

\[ \text{Difference in tens of thousands} = \frac{1,160,000}{10,000} \]
\[ \text{Difference in tens of thousands} = 116 \]

### Conclusion

The absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins as recorded on the Wikipedia page for penguin species populations at the end of 2018 and the population recorded in the Nature.com article from 2020 is **116 tens of thousands**.)

Row 149: Incorrect (Expected: 234.9, Got: I don't have access to the attached documents, so I can't directly view the data from the 2011 Bulgarian census. However, I can guide you on how to calculate the difference based on the gender split for those who have completed tertiary education.

1. **Identify the Numbers**: Find the number of men and women who have completed tertiary education from the 2011 Bulgarian census data.

2. **Calculate the Difference**: Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

3. **Convert to Thousands**: If the difference is not already in thousands, convert it by dividing by 1,000.

4. **Format the Result**: Ensure the result is in the format of thousands of women.

For example, if the census data shows:
- 200,000 men have completed tertiary education
- 230,000 women have completed tertiary education

Then:
1. The difference is \( 230,000 - 200,000 = 30,000 \).
2. Convert to thousands: \( 30,000 / 1,000 = 30 \).

So, the difference would be "30" thousand women.

Row 160: Incorrect (Expected: White; 5876, Got: To determine which astronaut from the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut in the 2006 January 21 APOD was a member of spent the least time in space, we need to identify the astronaut and their group first.

The smaller astronaut in the APOD from January 21, 2006, is Stephen Robinson. Stephen Robinson was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 14, also known as "The Hogs," which was selected in 1992.

Next, we need to find out which astronaut from Group 14 spent the least time in space, excluding those who did not fly at all. Here is a list of astronauts from Group 14 and their time in space:

1. Daniel T. Barry - 30d 14h 00m
2. Charles J. Camarda - 13d 21h 32m
3. Catherine G. Coleman - 180d 04h 00m
4. Michael E. Fossum - 194d 23h 16m
5. John M. Lounge - 20d 02h 00m
6. Scott E. Parazynski - 57d 15h 34m
7. Winston E. Scott - 24d 14h 34m
8. Joseph R. Tanner - 43d 13h 15m
9. Andy Thomas - 177d 09h 14m
10. Koichi Wakata - 347d 08h 33m
11. Mary E. Weber - 18d 18h 00m
12. Peter J. K. Wisoff - 32d 14h 00m

From this list, Charles J. Camarda spent the least time in space with 13 days, 21 hours, and 32 minutes. Converting this to minutes:

13 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 18,720 minutes
21 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1,260 minutes
32 minutes

Total = 18,720 + 1,260 + 32 = 20,012 minutes

Rounded to the nearest minute, Charles J. Camarda spent 20,012 minutes in space.

Therefore, the answer is:

Camarda;20012)
