        "returned_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to consider the concept of the false positive rate, which is directly related to the p-value threshold used for determining significance.\n\nA p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. This implies a 4% false positive rate, meaning that 4% of the papers could incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( N \\) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.\n- \\( p \\) as the p-value threshold, which is 0.04 in this case.\n\nThe number of incorrect papers due to false positives can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = N \\times p \\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = \\lceil N \\times 0.04 \\rceil \\]\n\nWithout the exact number of articles (\\( N \\)), we can't compute the exact number of incorrect papers. However, if you provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we can plug that value into the formula to get the result.\n\nFor example, if Nature published 1,000 articles in 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = \\lceil 1000 \\times 0.04 \\rceil = \\lceil 40 \\rceil = 40 \\]\n\nSo, if Nature published 1,000 articles, approximately 40 papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance.

(AAPL) has had several stock splits in its history, which can make it a bit tricky to track the stock price over time without adjustments. \n\nTo find the first year Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock price data. Apple had a 2-for-1 stock split on June 16, 1987, a 2-for-1 split on June 21, 2000, a 2-for-1 split on February 28, 2005, a 7-for-1 split on June 9, 2014, and a 4-for-1 split on August 31, 2020.\n\nGiven these splits, the stock price would have been significantly lower in earlier years when adjusted for splits. However, if you are looking for the unadjusted price, you would need to look at the stock price before these splits occurred.\n\nFor precise information, you can check historical stock prices on financial websites like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or other financial data providers. They often provide tools to view historical prices with and without adjustments for splits.",

However, I can provide some general information about how Connected Papers works and what might cause a node (or bubble) to be larger in their graph.\n\nConnected Papers is a tool used to visualize the academic literature around a specific paper. It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nIf you are referring to a specific paper within the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or a combination of these factors, with citation count being a primary driver.
