One such tool is the Wikimedia Dumps, which are periodic snapshots of the entire Wikipedia database.\n\n2. **Use Wikipedia\'s API**: Wikipedia\'s API can be used to query specific information.

It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size.
