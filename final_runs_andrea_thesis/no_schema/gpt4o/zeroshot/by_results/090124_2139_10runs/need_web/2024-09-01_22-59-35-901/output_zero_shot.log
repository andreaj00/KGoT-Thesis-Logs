This can typically be done by consulting the USDA or relevant regulatory body’s database or publications.\n\n4. **Calculate the Percentage:**\n   - Count the number of standards that have been superseded.\n   - Calculate the percentage using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Superseded} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Superseded Standards}}{\\text{Total Number of Relevant Standards}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n### Example Calculation (Hypothetical Data):\n\n1. **List the Items:**\n   - Assume there are 20 items in the "dried and dehydrated section" marked as dehydrated.\n   - Assume there are 10 items in the Frozen/Chilled section that meet the criteria.\n\n   Total relevant standards = 20 (dried and dehydrated) + 10 (Frozen/Chilled) = 30\n\n2. **Check for Superseded Standards:**\n   - Assume 18 out of the 30 standards have been superseded by new versions.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Superseded} = \\left( \\frac{18}{30} \\right) \\times 100 = 60\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, if 18 out of the 30 relevant standards have been superseded, the percentage of standards that have been superseded is 60%.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo get the exact percentage, you would need to follow the outlined steps with the actual data from the attached documents and the current standards database.

However, I can guide you on how to find the information you need.\n\nTo determine how many times a Twitter/X post was cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access Wikipedia\'s Database**: Wikipedia provides access to its database through various tools and APIs. You can use the Wikimedia Dumps or the Wikipedia API to extract data.\n\n2. **Extract Citation Data**: You would need to extract the citation data from the Wikipedia pages. This involves parsing the references section of each page to identify citations that link to Twitter/X.\n\n3. **Filter by Date**: Once you have the citation data, you can filter it by the date of the citation to determine how many times Twitter/X was cited each day in August.\n\n4. **Automate the Process**: Given the large volume of data, it would be efficient to write a script (using Python, for example) to automate the extraction and filtering process.\n\nHere is a basic outline of how you might write such a script in Python:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Function to get Wikipedia page content\ndef get_wikipedia_page_content(page_title):\n    url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=json&titles={page_title}"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n    page = next(iter(data[\'query\'][\'pages\'].values()))\n    return page[\'revisions\'][0][\'*\']\n\n# Function to extract citations from page content\ndef extract_citations(page_content):\n    citations = []\n    lines = page_content.split(\'\\n\')\n    for line in lines:\n        if \'twitter.com\' in line:\n            citations.append(line)\n    return citations\n\n# Function to filter citations by date\ndef filter_citations_by_date(citations, date):\n    filtered_citations = []\n    for citation in citations:\n        if date in citation:\n            filtered_citations.append(citation)\n    return filtered_citations\n\n# Example usage\npage_title = "Example_Wikipedia_Page"\npage_content = get_wikipedia_page_content(page_title)\ncitations = extract_citations(page_content)\n\n# Specify the date you are interested in\ndate = "2023-08-01"\nfiltered_citations = filter_citations_by_date(citations, date)\n\nprint(f"Number of Twitter/X citations on {date}: {len(filtered_citations)}")\n```\n\nThis script is a simplified example and may need to be adapted to handle the specific structure of Wikipedia pages and citations. Additionally, you would need to loop through all relevant Wikipedia pages and aggregate the results for each day in August.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, you might consider using more advanced data processing tools and techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP) to better identify and categorize citations.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 599, 'prompt_tokens': 49, 'total_tokens': 648}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-9c91ea9c-638e-4ffd-9ee4-03cac56842ae-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 49, 'output_tokens': 599, 'total_tokens': 648}
