A p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. Typically, a p-value threshold (alpha level) of 0.05 is used to determine statistical significance.\n\nGiven that the p-value is 0.04, we can infer that the false positive rate (Type I error rate) is 4%.

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).

The most notable stock splits occurred in 1987, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2020.\n\nIf you are looking for the first time Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock prices before any splits were applied. \n\nFor example, before the 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020, Apple's stock price was well above $400, which means it had surpassed $50 long before that. Similarly, before the 7-for-1 stock split in June 2014, Apple's stock price was above $600.\n\nTo find the exact year when Apple stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock price data from the early 2000s or late 1990s. Based on historical data, Apple stock first surpassed the $50 mark in the early 2000s, specifically around 2007.\n\nFor precise information, you can refer to historical stock price data available on financial websites like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or other financial data providers." response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 284, 'prompt_tokens': 39, 'total_tokens': 323}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-651c8716-9111-4618-9fda-112d7cdff503-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 39, 'output_tokens': 284, 'total_tokens': 323}

However, I can guide you on how to find this information yourself.\n\nTo determine how many times a Twitter/X post was cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access Wikipedia\'s Database**: Wikipedia provides a variety of tools and databases that can be used to analyze its content. One such tool is the Wikimedia Dumps, which are periodic snapshots of the entire Wikipedia database.\n\n2. **Use Wikipedia\'s API**: Wikipedia\'s API can be used to query specific information. You can write a script to search for references to Twitter/X in the citations of Wikipedia articles.\n\n3. **Third-Party Tools**: There are third-party tools and websites like WikiBlame or WikiHistory that can help track changes and references in Wikipedia articles.\n\n4. **Manual Search**: If the number of articles is manageable, you can manually check the references section of each article for citations of Twitter/X posts.\n\n5. **Data Analysis**: Once you have the data, you can use a spreadsheet or a database to organize and analyze the number of citations per day.\n\nIf you are familiar with programming, you can use Python with libraries like `requests` to interact with the Wikipedia API and `pandas` for data analysis.

It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nIf you are looking at the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or more of these factors, with citation count being a common primary reason.
