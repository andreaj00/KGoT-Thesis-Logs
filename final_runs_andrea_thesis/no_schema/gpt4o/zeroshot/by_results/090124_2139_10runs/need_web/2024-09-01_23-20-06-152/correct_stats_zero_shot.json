        "returned_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to understand the concept of the p-value and the significance level. A p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. Typically, a p-value threshold (alpha level) of 0.05 is used to determine statistical significance.\n\nGiven that the p-value is 0.04, we can infer that the false positive rate (Type I error rate) is 4%. This means that 4% of the papers that claim statistical significance might actually be incorrect in their claims.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( N \\) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.\n- \\( p \\) as the proportion of articles that are incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, which is 0.04.\n\nThe number of incorrect papers can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = N \\times p \\]\n\nSince we don't have the exact number of articles published by Nature in 2020, let's assume \\( N \\) is the total number of articles. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume \\( N \\) is 1000 (you can replace this with the actual number if known).\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = 1000 \\times 0.04 = 40 \\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, the number of incorrect papers would be:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = \\lceil 40 \\rceil = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Nature published 1000 articles in 2020, approximately 40 of them would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance. If the actual number of articles is different, you can adjust the calculation accordingly.",

(AAPL) has had several stock splits over the years, which can make it a bit tricky to track the stock price history without adjustments. The most notable stock splits occurred in 1987, 2000, 2005, 2014, and 2020.\n\nIf you are looking for the first time Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock prices before any splits were applied. \n\nFor example, before the 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020, Apple's stock price was well above $400, which means it had surpassed $50 long before that. Similarly, before the 7-for-1 stock split in June 2014, Apple's stock price was above $600.\n\nTo find the exact year when Apple stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock price data from the early 2000s or late 1990s. Based on historical data, Apple stock first surpassed the $50 mark in the early 2000s, specifically around 2007.\n\nFor precise information, you can refer to historical stock price data available on financial websites like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or other financial data providers.",

One such tool is the Wikimedia Dumps, which are periodic snapshots of the entire Wikipedia database.\n\n2. **Use Wikipedia's API**: Wikipedia's API can be used to query specific information. You can write a script to search for references to Twitter/X in the citations of Wikipedia articles.\n\n3. **Third-Party Tools**: There are third-party tools and websites like WikiBlame or WikiHistory that can help track changes and references in Wikipedia articles.\n\n4. **Manual Search**: If the number of articles is manageable, you can manually check the references section of each article for citations of Twitter/X posts.\n\n5. **Data Analysis**: Once you have the data, you can use a spreadsheet or a database to organize and analyze the number of citations per day.\n\nIf you are familiar with programming, you can use Python with libraries like `requests` to interact with the Wikipedia API and `pandas` for data analysis.

However, I can provide some general information about how Connected Papers works and what might cause a node (or bubble) to be larger in their graph.\n\nConnected Papers is a tool used to visualize the academic literature around a specific paper. It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nIf you are looking at the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or more of these factors, with citation count being a common primary reason.
