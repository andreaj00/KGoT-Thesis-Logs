Greetham, David. "Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)." Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46. Project MUSE, doi:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.

And this is the in-line citation:

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).

However, I can guide you on how to find this information yourself.\n\nTo determine how many times a Twitter/X post was cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August, you would need to:\n\n1. **Access Wikipedia\'s Database**: Wikipedia provides public access to its database through various tools and APIs. You can use the Wikipedia API or download database dumps from [Wikimedia Dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/).\n\n2. **Extract References**: Once you have access to the data, you can write a script to parse the references in the articles. Look for URLs that point to Twitter/X.\n\n3. **Filter by Date**: Since you are interested in citations for each day of August, you will need to filter the references by the date they were added. This can be done by examining the edit history of each page.\n\n4. **Count Citations**: Finally, count the number of times Twitter/X posts were cited for each day.\n\nHere is a rough outline of how you might approach this programmatically:\n\n### Using Wikipedia API\n\n1. **Get List of Articles**:\n   - Use the Wikipedia API to get a list of articles that were edited in August 2023.\n\n2. **Fetch Article Revisions**:\n   - For each article, fetch the revision history for August 2023.\n\n3. **Parse Revisions**:\n   - Parse each revision to extract references. Look for URLs that match the Twitter/X domain.\n\n4. **Count Citations**:\n   - Count the number of Twitter/X citations for each day.\n\n### Example Code (Python)\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef get_articles_edited_in_august():\n    # Example function to get articles edited in August 2023\n    # You will need to use the Wikipedia API to get this data\n    pass\n\ndef get_revisions_for_article(article_title):\n    # Example function to get revisions for a given article\n    # You will need to use the Wikipedia API to get this data\n    pass\n\ndef count_twitter_citations(revisions):\n    twitter_citations = {}\n    for revision in revisions:\n        date = revision[\'timestamp\'][:10]  # Extract date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        if \'twitter.com\' in revision[\'content\']:\n            if date not in twitter_citations:\n                twitter_citations[date] = 0\n            twitter_citations[date] += 1\n    return twitter_citations\n\ndef main():\n    articles = get_articles_edited_in_august()\n    twitter_citations_per_day = {}\n    \n    for article in articles:\n        revisions = get_revisions_for_article(article)\n        daily_citations = count_twitter_citations(revisions)\n        \n        for date, count in daily_citations.items():\n            if date not in twitter_citations_per_day:\n                twitter_citations_per_day[date] = 0\n            twitter_citations_per_day[date] += count\n    \n    for date, count in sorted(twitter_citations_per_day.items()):\n        print(f"{date}: {count} Twitter/X citations")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- This is a simplified example. You will need to handle API rate limits, pagination, and possibly large data sets.\n- The actual implementation will require more detailed handling of the Wikipedia API and parsing of the article content.\n\nIf you are not familiar with programming, you might consider reaching out to someone with technical expertise or using tools like [WikiBlame](https://wikipedia.ramselehof.de/wikiblame.php) to manually check the edit history of specific articles.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 764, 'prompt_tokens': 49, 'total_tokens': 813}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-39b29858-13c5-4ece-b17a-ef5b5ddae411-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 49, 'output_tokens': 764, 'total_tokens': 813}
