        "returned_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to consider the concept of the false positive rate, which is directly related to the p-value threshold used for determining significance.\n\nA p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. This implies a 4% false positive rate, meaning that 4% of the papers could incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( N \\) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.\n- \\( p \\) as the p-value threshold, which is 0.04 in this case.\n\nThe number of incorrect papers due to false positives can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = N \\times p \\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers (rounded up)} = \\lceil N \\times p \\rceil \\]\n\nWithout the exact number of articles (\\( N \\)), we can't compute the exact number of incorrect papers. However, if you provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we can plug that value into the formula to get the result.\n\nFor example, if Nature published 1,000 articles in 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = 1000 \\times 0.04 = 40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers (rounded up)} = \\lceil 40 \\rceil = 40 \\]\n\nSo, if Nature published 1,000 articles, approximately 40 papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance.

For example, you might try `label:Regression polynomial` or similar queries.\n\n5. **Sort by Oldest**: Once you have the filtered list, sort the issues by the oldest first. This can typically be done by clicking on the sorting options and selecting \"Oldest\".\n\n6. **Check Closed Issues**: Ensure that you are looking at closed issues. You can add `is:closed` to your search query to filter out only closed issues.\n\n7. **Review Issue Details**: Click on the oldest closed issue to view its details.

Therefore, he was not consecrated as a bishop, and there would be no consecrators or co-consecrators for him in that context.\n\nGiven this information, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question. Since Saint Francis Xavier was not a bishop, there are no consecrators or co-consecrators associated with him. Therefore, the question of identifying a consecrator or co-consecrator who never became pope does not apply to this specific portrait.",

However, I can provide some general information about how Connected Papers works and what might cause a node (or bubble) to be larger in their graph.\n\nConnected Papers is a tool used to visualize the academic literature around a specific paper. It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nIf you are referring to the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or more of these factors, with citation count being a common primary reason.
