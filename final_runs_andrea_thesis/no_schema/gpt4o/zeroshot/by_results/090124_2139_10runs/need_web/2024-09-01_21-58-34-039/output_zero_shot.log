This implies a 4% false positive rate, meaning that 4% of the papers could incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( N \\) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.\n- \\( p \\) as the p-value threshold, which is 0.04 in this case.\n\nThe number of incorrect papers due to false positives can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = N \\times p \\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers (rounded up)} = \\lceil N \\times p \\rceil \\]\n\nWithout the exact number of articles (\\( N \\)), we can't compute the exact number of incorrect papers. However, if you provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we can plug that value into the formula to get the result.\n\nFor example, if Nature published 1,000 articles in 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers} = 1000 \\times 0.04 = 40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of incorrect papers (rounded up)} = \\lceil 40 \\rceil = 40 \\]\n\nSo, if Nature published 1,000 articles, approximately 40 papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance.

However, I can guide you on how to find this information yourself.\n\nTo determine how many times a Twitter/X post was cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Access Wikipedia\'s Database**: Wikipedia provides a variety of tools and databases that can be used to analyze its content. One such tool is the Wikimedia Dumps, which are periodic snapshots of the entire Wikipedia database.\n\n2. **Use Wikipedia\'s API**: Wikipedia\'s API can be used to query specific information. You can write a script to search for references to Twitter/X in the citations of Wikipedia articles.\n\n3. **Third-Party Tools**: There are third-party tools and websites like WikiBlame or WikiHistory that can help track changes and references in Wikipedia articles.\n\n4. **Manual Search**: If you are looking for a smaller dataset, you can manually check the references section of Wikipedia articles for citations of Twitter/X posts.\n\n5. **Data Analysis**: Once you have the data, you can use a spreadsheet or a database to organize and analyze the number of citations per day.\n\nIf you are familiar with programming, you can use Python with libraries like `requests` to interact with the Wikipedia API and `pandas` for data analysis. Here is a very basic example of how you might start:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Example function to get references from a Wikipedia page\ndef get_references(page_title):\n    url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extlinks&titles={page_title}&format=json"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n    references = []\n    pages = data[\'query\'][\'pages\']\n    for page_id in pages:\n        if \'extlinks\' in pages[page_id]:\n            for link in pages[page_id][\'extlinks\']:\n                references.append(link[\'*\'])\n    return references\n\n# Example usage\npage_title = "Example_Page"\nreferences = get_references(page_title)\ntwitter_references = [ref for ref in references if "twitter.com" in ref]\nprint(f"Number of Twitter references: {len(twitter_references)}")\n```\n\nThis script is a starting point and would need to be expanded to handle multiple pages and dates.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, you might need to download the full Wikipedia dump and process it with more advanced data processing tools.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 504, 'prompt_tokens': 49, 'total_tokens': 553}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-e679c34a-76df-4059-bb11-6be5ccbbe67b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 49, 'output_tokens': 504, 'total_tokens': 553}

It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nIf you are referring to the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, the largest bubble is likely due to one or more of these factors, with citation count being a common primary reason.
