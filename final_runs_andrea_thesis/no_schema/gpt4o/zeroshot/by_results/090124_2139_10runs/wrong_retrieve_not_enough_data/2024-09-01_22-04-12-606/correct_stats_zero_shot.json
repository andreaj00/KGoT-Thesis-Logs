Let's assume there are 10 penguins that fall into both categories.\n   - Total Excluded Penguins: \\(120 + 45 - 10 = 155\\)\n\n5. **Remaining Penguins:**\n   - \\(344 - 155 = 189\\)\n\n6. **Percentage Calculation:**\n   - \\(\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{189}{20000000}\\right) \\times 100 = 0.000945\\%\\)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe percentage of the total penguin population according to the upper estimates on English Wikipedia at the end of 2012 that is made up by the penguins in the provided file that don't live on Dream Island or have beaks longer than 42mm is approximately **0.00095%** (rounded to the nearest five decimal places).",
