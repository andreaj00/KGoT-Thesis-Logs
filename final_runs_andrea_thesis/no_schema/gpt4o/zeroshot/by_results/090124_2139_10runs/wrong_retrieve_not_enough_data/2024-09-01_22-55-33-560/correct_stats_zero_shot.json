        "returned_answer": "To determine how many thousand hours it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the minimum perigee distance between the Earth and the Moon.**\n2. **Determine Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace.**\n3. **Calculate the time it would take to run the distance.**\n\n### Step 1: Minimum Perigee Distance\nAccording to the Wikipedia page for the Moon, the minimum perigee (closest approach) distance is approximately 356,500 kilometers.\n\n### Step 2: Eliud Kipchoge's Marathon Pace\nEliud Kipchoge set the marathon world record with a time of 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds. First, we convert this time into hours:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60} + \\frac{39 \\text{ seconds}}{3600} \\]\n\\[ = 2 + \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{39}{3600} \\]\n\\[ = 2 + 0.0167 + 0.0108 \\]\n\\[ \\approx 2.0275 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers. Therefore, his pace in kilometers per hour (km/h) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pace} = \\frac{42.195 \\text{ km}}{2.0275 \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\\[ \\approx 20.81 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Run the Distance\nNow, we need to calculate the time it would take to run 356,500 kilometers at a pace of 20.81 km/h:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{356,500 \\text{ km}}{20.81 \\text{ km/h}} \\]\n\\[ \\approx 17128.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n### Convert to Thousand Hours and Round\nFinally, we convert this time into thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours:\n\n\\[ 17128.5 \\text{ hours} \\approx 17000 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately **17000** thousand hours for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach.",
