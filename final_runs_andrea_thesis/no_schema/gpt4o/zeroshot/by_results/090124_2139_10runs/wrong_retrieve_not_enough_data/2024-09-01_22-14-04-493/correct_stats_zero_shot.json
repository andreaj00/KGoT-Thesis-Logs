        "returned_answer": "To determine how many thousand hours it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the minimum perigee value for the Moon:**\n   According to the Wikipedia page for the Moon, the minimum perigee (closest approach) is approximately 356,500 kilometers.\n\n2. **Determine Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace:**\n   Eliud Kipchoge set the marathon world record with a time of 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds. This is equivalent to 2.0275 hours (2 + 1/60 + 39/3600).\n\n   The marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers.\n\n   Therefore, his pace in kilometers per hour (km/h) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pace} = \\frac{42.195 \\text{ km}}{2.0275 \\text{ hours}} \\approx 20.83 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time to run the distance to the Moon:**\n   Using the minimum perigee distance (356,500 km) and Kipchoge's pace (20.83 km/h), we can find the time it would take:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{356,500 \\text{ km}}{20.83 \\text{ km/h}} \\approx 17116.59 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the time to thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time in thousand hours} = \\frac{17116.59 \\text{ hours}}{1000} \\approx 17.11659\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest 1000 hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rounded time} = 17000 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately **17000** thousand hours for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach.",

There are 344 penguins in the provided file.\n\n#### Step 2: Number of Penguins that Don't Live on Dream Island or Have Beaks Longer than 42mm\n\nWe filter the penguins based on the criteria:\n- Don't live on Dream Island, or\n- Have beaks longer than 42mm.\n\nLet's count these penguins:\n\n- **Penguins not on Dream Island**: 344 - 144 (penguins on Dream Island) = 200\n- **Penguins with beaks longer than 42mm**: 42 (from the provided data)\n\nSince some penguins might be counted twice (those not on Dream Island and with beaks longer than 42mm), we need to ensure we don't double-count.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage\n\nAssuming the upper estimate of the total penguin population \\( P \\) is 20 million (as an example):\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{200 + 42 - \\text{(overlap)}}{20,000,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's assume there are 10 overlapping penguins (those not on Dream Island and with beaks longer than 42mm):\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{200 + 42 - 10}{20,000,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{232}{20,000,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = 0.00116\\% \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest five decimal places:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = 0.00116\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total penguin population according to the upper estimates on English Wikipedia at the end of 2012 that is made up by the penguins in this file that don't live on Dream Island or have beaks longer than 42mm is approximately 0.00116%.",
