Final Result: content="To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location, specifically the pressure and temperature. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since we don't have the exact density values for Freon-12 at 1100 atm and 2°C, we can use the general properties of Freon-12 and apply the compressibility factor (Z) to estimate the volume.\n\n1. **Molar Mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2):**\n   - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n   - Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol (2 atoms)\n   - Fluorine (F): 19.00 g/mol (2 atoms)\n   - Molar mass = 12.01 + (2 × 35.45) + (2 × 19.00) = 120.91 g/mol\n\n2. **Convert mass to moles:**\n   - Mass = 0.312 kg = 312 g\n   - Moles = mass / molar mass = 312 g / 120.91 g/mol ≈ 2.58 mol\n\n3. **Ideal Gas Law (for reference):**\n   - \\( PV = nRT \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is pressure, \\( V \\) is volume, \\( n \\) is moles, \\( R \\) is the gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)), and \\( T \\) is temperature in Kelvin.\n\n4. **Adjust for Real Gas Behavior:**\n   - At high pressures, gases deviate from ideal behavior. The compressibility factor \\( Z \\) accounts for this deviation.\n   - \\( PV = ZnRT \\)\n   - For Freon-12, \\( Z \\) at 1100 atm and 2°C is not readily available, but we can estimate it based on typical values for similar conditions. Let's assume \\( Z \\approx 0.8 \\) (a reasonable estimate for high pressure).\n\n5. **Calculate Volume:**\n   - Rearrange the real gas equation to solve for \\( V \\):\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{ZnRT}{P}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{0.8 \\times 2.58 \\text{ mol} \\times 0.0821 \\text{ L·atm/(mol·K)} \\times 275.15 \\text{ K}}{1100 \\text{ atm}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V \\approx \\frac{0.8 \\times 2.58 \\times 0.0821 \\times 275.15}{1100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V \\approx \\frac{46.1}{1100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V \\approx 0.0419 \\text{ L}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Convert to milliliters:**\n   - \\( 0.0419 \\text{ L} = 41.9 \\text{ mL} \\)\n\nRounding to the nearest milliliter, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is approximately:\n\n**42 mL**" response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 765, 'prompt_tokens': 78, 'total_tokens': 843}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_fde2829a40', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-ea15874d-49a7-4a5d-9e0d-4a98f811b25b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 78, 'output_tokens': 765, 'total_tokens': 843}

Since we already have a Paladin tank, the Druid must be in a DPS role, specifically Feral DPS.\n\n**Metamorphosis:**\n- Metamorphosis is a spell used by **Demon Hunters** in their DPS specialization (Havoc).\n\n**Ice and Fire Spells:**\n- **Ice:** Typically used by a **Mage** (Frost specialization).\n- **Fire:** Typically used by a **Mage** (Fire specialization).\n\nSince we need unique classes and we already have a Druid and a Demon Hunter, the Mage must be the one using either ice or fire spells.\n\n**Armor Types:**\n- **Plate Wearers:** Paladin (Tank) and one more class.\n- **Cloth Wearers:** Priest (Healer) and Mage (DPS).\n\nGiven the above, the remaining class must be a plate wearer and a DPS.
