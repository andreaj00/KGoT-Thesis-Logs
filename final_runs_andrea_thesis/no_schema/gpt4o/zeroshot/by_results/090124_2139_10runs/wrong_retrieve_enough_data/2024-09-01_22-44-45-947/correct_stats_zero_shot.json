The ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using a weighted sum of the first 9 digits, with weights decreasing from 10 to 2, and then taking the modulus 11 of the sum. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Check digit} = (10 \\cdot d_1 + 9 \\cdot d_2 + 8 \\cdot d_3 + 7 \\cdot d_4 + 6 \\cdot d_5 + 5 \\cdot d_6 + 4 \\cdot d_7 + 3 \\cdot d_8 + 2 \\cdot d_9) \\mod 11 \\]\n\nIf the result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. Otherwise, it is the result itself.\n\nFirst, we need the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales. Since I don't have access to the attached documents, I'll assume you have the Tropicos ID. Let's say the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is \"123456789\" (you should replace this with the actual ID).\n\nLet's compute the check digit for the ID \"123456789\":\n\n1. Multiply each digit by its weight:\n   \\[\n   10 \\cdot 1 + 9 \\cdot 2 + 8 \\cdot 3 + 7 \\cdot 4 + 6 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 6 + 4 \\cdot 7 + 3 \\cdot 8 + 2 \\cdot 9\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   10 \\cdot 1 = 10 \\\\\n   9 \\cdot 2 = 18 \\\\\n   8 \\cdot 3 = 24 \\\\\n   7 \\cdot 4 = 28 \\\\\n   6 \\cdot 5 = 30 \\\\\n   5 \\cdot 6 = 30 \\\\\n   4 \\cdot 7 = 28 \\\\\n   3 \\cdot 8 = 24 \\\\\n   2 \\cdot 9 = 18 \\\\\n   \\]\n\n   Sum = 10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 30 + 30 + 28 + 24 + 18 = 210\n\n3. Compute the modulus 11 of the sum:\n   \\[\n   210 \\mod 11 = 1\n   \\]\n\nSo, the check digit for the Tropicos ID \"123456789\" as if it were an ISBN-10 number is 1.\n\nPlease replace \"123456789\" with the actual Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales and follow the same steps to get the correct check digit.",

        "returned_answer": "To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location, specifically the pressure and temperature. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2\u00b0C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since we don't have the exact density values for Freon-12 at 1100 atm and 2\u00b0C, we can use the general properties of Freon-12 and apply the compressibility factor (Z) to estimate the volume.\n\n1. **Molar Mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2):**\n   - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n   - Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol (2 atoms)\n   - Fluorine (F): 19.00 g/mol (2 atoms)\n   - Molar mass = 12.01 + (2 \u00d7 35.45) + (2 \u00d7 19.00) = 120.91 g/mol\n\n2. **Convert mass to moles:**\n   - Mass = 0.312 kg = 312 g\n   - Moles = mass / molar mass = 312 g / 120.91 g/mol \u2248 2.58 mol\n\n3. **Ideal Gas Law (for reference):**\n   - \\( PV = nRT \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is pressure, \\( V \\) is volume, \\( n \\) is moles, \\( R \\) is the gas constant (0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)), and \\( T \\) is temperature in Kelvin.\n\n4. **Adjust for Real Gas Behavior:**\n   - At high pressures, gases deviate from ideal behavior. The compressibility factor \\( Z \\) accounts for this deviation.\n   - \\( PV = ZnRT \\)\n   - For Freon-12, \\( Z \\) at 1100 atm and 2\u00b0C is not readily available, but we can estimate it based on typical values for similar conditions. Let's assume \\( Z \\approx 0.8 \\) (a reasonable estimate for high pressure).\n\n5. **Calculate Volume:**\n   - Rearrange the real gas equation to solve for \\( V \\):\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{ZnRT}{P}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{0.8 \\times 2.58 \\text{ mol} \\times 0.0821 \\text{ L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)} \\times 275.15 \\text{ K}}{1100 \\text{ atm}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V \\approx \\frac{0.8 \\times 2.58 \\times 0.0821 \\times 275.15}{1100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V \\approx \\frac{46.1}{1100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V \\approx 0.0419 \\text{ L}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Convert to milliliters:**\n   - \\( 0.0419 \\text{ L} = 41.9 \\text{ mL} \\)\n\nRounding to the nearest milliliter, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is approximately:\n\n**42 mL**",
