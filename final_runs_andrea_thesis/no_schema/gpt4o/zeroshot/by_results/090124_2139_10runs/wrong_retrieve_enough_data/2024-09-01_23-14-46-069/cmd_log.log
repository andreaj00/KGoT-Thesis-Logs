Row 3: Incorrect (Expected: backtick, Got: The code provided is almost correct but is missing a crucial character to properly output "For penguins". In Unlambda, the `i` combinator is used to output the result of the program. The code you provided ends with `i`, which is correct, but it lacks the `k` combinator to discard the extra arguments and ensure the correct sequence of characters is output.

The exact character needed to correct the code is the backtick character, also known as the grave accent. This character is used in Unlambda to apply functions.

Here is the corrected code:

```
`r```````````.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.s`ki
```

So, the character needed is the **backtick**.)

Row 28: Incorrect (Expected: Fred, Got: To determine who did not give a gift, we need to match each gift to the recipient's interests and then check if any employee did not give a gift.

First, let's match the gifts to the recipients based on their interests:

1. **Galileo Galilei biography** - This would likely go to someone interested in Astronomy, which matches **Miguel**.
2. **Fishing reel** - This matches **Harry**'s interest in Fishing.
3. **Raku programming guide** - This is a bit tricky, but since Raku is a programming language, it might be related to **Fred**'s interest in Perl.
4. **Chisel set** - This matches **Jun**'s interest in Woodworking.
5. **Custom dice** - This matches **Sara**'s interest in Tabletop RPGs.
6. **“War and Peace” American film copy** - This matches **Perry**'s interest in Old Movies.
7. **Yarn** - This matches **Micah**'s interest in Knitting.
8. **“One Piece” graphic novel** - This matches **Alex**'s interest in Manga.
9. **“War and Peace” novel** - This matches **Tyson**'s interest in Historical Fiction Novels.
10. **Starbucks gift card** - This matches **Lucy**'s interest in Coffee.
11. **Foam exercise mat** - This matches **Georgette**'s interest in Yoga.

Now, let's check the gift assignments to see who gave each gift:

1. **Harry** gave a gift to **Miguel**.
2. **Rebecca** gave a gift to **Micah**.
3. **Georgette** gave a gift to **Lucy**.
4. **Micah** gave a gift to **Jun**.
5. **Perry** gave a gift to **Georgette**.
6. **Tyson** gave a gift to **Fred**.
7. **Lucy** gave a gift to **Alex**.
8. **Jun** gave a gift to **Harry**.
9. **Sara** gave a gift to **Perry**.
10. **Fred** gave a gift to **Rebecca**.
11. **Miguel** gave a gift to **Sara**.
12. **Alex** gave a gift to **Tyson**.

Since only eleven gifts were given, one person did not give a gift. By checking the list of who gave gifts, we can see that **Rebecca** did not receive a gift. Therefore, the person who was supposed to give a gift to **Rebecca** did not give a gift.

According to the gift assignments, **Fred** was supposed to give a gift to **Rebecca**. However, since **Fred** did give a gift (the Raku programming guide), it means that the person who was supposed to give a gift to **Fred** did not give a gift.

The person who was supposed to give a gift to **Fred** is **Tyson**. Therefore, **Tyson** did not give a gift.)

Docs: []
Query with Attached Docs: Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for the Tropicos ID of the Order Helotiales as if it were an ISBN-10 number, we need to follow the ISBN-10 check digit calculation method. The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8206.

The ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:

1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).
2. Sum these products.
3. Find the remainder of the sum when divided by 11.
4. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is 'X'. Otherwise, the check digit is the remainder.

Since the Tropicos ID 8206 has only 4 digits, we will treat it as if it were the first 4 digits of a 9-digit sequence, with the remaining digits being zeros.

Let's compute the check digit step-by-step:

1. Write out the digits and their positions:
   - 8 (position 1)
   - 2 (position 2)
   - 0 (position 3)
   - 6 (position 4)
   - 0 (position 5)
   - 0 (position 6)
   - 0 (position 7)
   - 0 (position 8)
   - 0 (position 9)

2. Multiply each digit by its position:
   - 8 * 1 = 8
   - 2 * 2 = 4
   - 0 * 3 = 0
   - 6 * 4 = 24
   - 0 * 5 = 0
   - 0 * 6 = 0
   - 0 * 7 = 0
   - 0 * 8 = 0
   - 0 * 9 = 0

3. Sum these products:
   - 8 + 4 + 0 + 24 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 36

4. Find the remainder of the sum when divided by 11:
   - 36 % 11 = 3

Therefore, the check digit for the Tropicos ID 8206, if it were an ISBN-10 number, is 3.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).

First, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since we don't have the exact density data for Freon-12 at 1100 atm and 2°C, we can use the general properties of Freon-12 and make some approximations.

Freon-12 has a critical temperature of 111.97°C and a critical pressure of 41.13 atm. At standard conditions (1 atm and 25°C), the density of Freon-12 is approximately 1.311 g/cm³. However, under high pressure, the density will be significantly higher.

Given the high pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we can assume that Freon-12 will be in a liquid state, and its density will be close to that of a liquid under high pressure. For simplicity, let's assume the density of liquid Freon-12 under these conditions is approximately 1.5 g/cm³ (this is a rough estimate, as the actual density could be higher).

Now, we can calculate the volume using the mass and the estimated density:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \]

Rearranging to solve for volume:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} \]

Given:
- Mass = 0.312 kg = 312 g
- Density ≈ 1.5 g/cm³

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{312 \text{ g}}{1.5 \text{ g/cm}^3} \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 208 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Since 1 cm³ = 1 mL, the volume in milliliters is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 208 \text{ mL} \]

Therefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest mL, is:

\[ \boxed{208} \])

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance of your trip:**
   - From Los Angeles, CA to Cincinnati, OH via I-40: approximately 2,200 miles.
   - From Cincinnati, OH to Augusta, ME via I-90: approximately 900 miles.
   - Total distance: 2,200 miles + 900 miles = 3,100 miles.

2. **Determine the number of 100-mile segments:**
   - Total distance: 3,100 miles.
   - Number of 100-mile segments: 3,100 miles / 100 miles per segment = 31 segments.

3. **Calculate the total number of water bottles consumed:**
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - Total water bottles: 31 segments * 5 bottles per segment = 155 bottles.

4. **Determine the recycling refund value:**
   - According to Wikipedia, the refund value for recycling water bottles varies by state. For simplicity, let's assume the average refund value is $0.05 per bottle (this is a common value in many states with bottle deposit laws).

5. **Calculate the total refund amount:**
   - Total refund: 155 bottles * $0.05 per bottle = $7.75.

Therefore, you will get back approximately $7.75 from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 145: Incorrect (Expected: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Got: To determine the five classes in the group, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Roles and Armor Types:**
   - **Tank**: Plate wearer
   - **Healer**: Plate wearer
   - **DPS**: Two cloth wearers and one other (not specified)

2. **Spell Types:**
   - **Tank and Healer**: Casting holy spells
   - **DPS**: One using ice spells, one using fire spells, and one is a bear (which implies a Druid in bear form)

3. **Special Abilities:**
   - **Metamorphosis**: This is a Demon Hunter ability.

4. **Loot:**
   - **Kilt of the Forgotten One**: No one can use it, implying it is not suitable for any of the classes present.

5. **Class Abilities and Uniqueness:**
   - **Tank**: Plate wearer casting holy spells (Paladin)
   - **Healer**: Plate wearer casting holy spells (Paladin)
   - **DPS**: 
     - Ice spells (Mage)
     - Fire spells (Mage)
     - Bear form (Druid)
   - **Metamorphosis**: Demon Hunter

Given that all classes are unique, we need to adjust the roles to fit the unique class requirement:

- **Tank**: Paladin (Plate, Holy spells)
- **Healer**: Paladin (Plate, Holy spells)
- **DPS**:
  - Ice spells: Mage (Cloth)
  - Fire spells: Mage (Cloth)
  - Bear form: Druid (Leather)
- **Metamorphosis**: Demon Hunter (Leather)

Since we need unique classes, we must correct the roles:

- **Tank**: Paladin (Plate, Holy spells)
- **Healer**: Priest (Cloth, Holy spells)
- **DPS**:
  - Ice spells: Mage (Cloth)
  - Fire spells: Mage (Cloth)
  - Bear form: Druid (Leather)
- **Metamorphosis**: Demon Hunter (Leather)

However, we need to ensure all classes are unique:

- **Tank**: Paladin (Plate, Holy spells)
- **Healer**: Priest (Cloth, Holy spells)
- **DPS**:
  - Ice spells: Mage (Cloth)
  - Fire spells: Warlock (Cloth)
  - Bear form: Druid (Leather)
- **Metamorphosis**: Demon Hunter (Leather)

Thus, the five unique classes in alphabetical order are:

**Demon Hunter, Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest**)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of "Survivor," there have been 44 unique winners, as each season typically crowns a new winner.

For "American Idol," as of the end of its 21st season, there have been 21 unique winners, as each season also typically crowns a new winner.

To find the difference in the number of unique winners between "Survivor" and "American Idol":

- "Survivor" has 44 unique winners.
- "American Idol" has 21 unique winners.

The difference is:
44 (Survivor) - 21 (American Idol) = 23

So, there have been 23 more unique winners of "Survivor" compared to "American Idol.")
