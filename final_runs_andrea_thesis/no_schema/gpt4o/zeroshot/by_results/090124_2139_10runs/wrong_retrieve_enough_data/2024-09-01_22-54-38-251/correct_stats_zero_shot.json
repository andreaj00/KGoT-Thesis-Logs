This information is typically available in the release notes or the repository's commit history.\n\nSince I don't have access to the attached documents, I will provide a general approach to finding this information:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added. This can be found in the OpenCV release notes or documentation.\n- **Step 2:** Check the list of contributors for that version. This can be done by looking at the commit history on the OpenCV GitHub repository or the contributors listed in the release notes.\n\nIf you have access to the specific version and the list of contributors, you can compare the names of the contributors to the name \"Wen Jiabao.\"\n\nFor example, if the list of contributors includes a name like \"Wen Jia\" or \"Bao Wen,\" it would match the transliterated name of the former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.\n\nWithout the specific documents, I can't provide the exact name, but the process above should help you identify the contributor with the same name as the former Chinese head of government.",

The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8207.\n\nThe ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).\n2. Sum these products.\n3. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum.\n4. The check digit is the result of 11 minus the modulo result. If the result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. If the result is 11, the check digit is '0'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the Tropicos ID 8207:\n\n1. Write the ID as a 9-digit number by padding with leading zeros: 000008207.\n2. Multiply each digit by its position:\n   - 0 * 1 = 0\n   - 0 * 2 = 0\n   - 0 * 3 = 0\n   - 0 * 4 = 0\n   - 0 * 5 = 0\n   - 8 * 6 = 48\n   - 2 * 7 = 14\n   - 0 * 8 = 0\n   - 7 * 9 = 63\n\n3. Sum these products:\n   0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 48 + 14 + 0 + 63 = 125\n\n4. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum:\n   125 % 11 = 4\n\n5.

        "returned_answer": "To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2\u00b0C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since the density of Freon-12 at such extreme conditions is not readily available, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation. This approximation is reasonable because Freon-12 is a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure (in atm)\n- \\( V \\) is the volume (in liters)\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K))\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Freon-12. The molar mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is:\n\\[ 12.01 \\, (\\text{C}) + 2 \\times 35.45 \\, (\\text{Cl}) + 2 \\times 19.00 \\, (\\text{F}) = 120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nGiven the mass of Freon-12 is 0.312 kg (312 grams), the number of moles \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ n = \\frac{312 \\, \\text{g}}{120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume \\( V \\):\n\\[ V = \\frac{nRT}{P} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ P = 1100 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\\[ T = 275.15 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\\[ R = 0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)} \\]\n\\[ n = 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{2.58 \\times 0.0821 \\times 275.15}{1100} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx \\frac{58.36}{1100} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nTo convert this volume to milliliters (mL):\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mL/L} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 53 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{53} \\]",

The states you will pass through with bottle deposit laws include California, Maine, and possibly others depending on your exact route.\n   - California: $0.05 per bottle.\n   - Maine: $0.05 per bottle.\n\n4. **Calculate the total refund:**\n   - Since you start in California and end in Maine, and both states have a $0.05 refund rate, we can use this rate for simplicity.\n   - Total refund: 155 bottles * $0.05/bottle = $7.75.\n\nTherefore, you will get back $7.75 from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.",
