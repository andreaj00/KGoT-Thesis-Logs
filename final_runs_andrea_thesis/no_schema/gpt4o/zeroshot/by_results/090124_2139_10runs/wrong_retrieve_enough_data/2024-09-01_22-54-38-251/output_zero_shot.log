Final Result: content="To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since the density of Freon-12 at such extreme conditions is not readily available, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation. This approximation is reasonable because Freon-12 is a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure (in atm)\n- \\( V \\) is the volume (in liters)\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of Freon-12.

Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it.
