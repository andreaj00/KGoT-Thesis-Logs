1. **Galileo Galilei biography** - This would likely go to someone interested in Astronomy, which matches **Miguel**.
2. **Fishing reel** - This matches **Harry**'s interest in Fishing.
3. **Raku programming guide** - This could be for someone interested in programming, which matches **Fred**'s interest in Perl.
4. **Chisel set** - This matches **Jun**'s interest in Woodworking.
5. **Custom dice** - This matches **Sara**'s interest in Tabletop RPGs.
6. **“War and Peace” American film copy** - This matches **Perry**'s interest in Old Movies.
7. **Yarn** - This matches **Micah**'s interest in Knitting.
8. **“One Piece” graphic novel** - This matches **Alex**'s interest in Manga.
9. **“War and Peace” novel** - This matches **Tyson**'s interest in Historical Fiction Novels.
10. **Starbucks gift card** - This matches **Lucy**'s interest in Coffee.
11. **Foam exercise mat** - This matches **Georgette**'s interest in Yoga.

Now, let's check the gift assignments to see who gave each gift:

1. **Harry** gave a gift to **Miguel**.
2. **Rebecca** gave a gift to **Micah**.
3. **Georgette** gave a gift to **Lucy**.
4. **Micah** gave a gift to **Jun**.
5. **Perry** gave a gift to **Georgette**.

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for the Tropicos ID of the Order Helotiales as if it were an ISBN-10 number, we need to follow the ISBN-10 check digit calculation method. The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8207.

The ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:

1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).
2. Sum these products.
3. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum.
4. The check digit is the result of 11 minus the modulo 11 result. If this result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. If the result is 11, the check digit is 0.

Let's apply these steps to the Tropicos ID 8207:

1. Write the ID as a 9-digit number by padding with leading zeros: 000008207.
2. Multiply each digit by its position:
   - 0 * 1 = 0
   - 0 * 2 = 0
   - 0 * 3 = 0
   - 0 * 4 = 0
   - 0 * 5 = 0
   - 8 * 6 = 48
   - 2 * 7 = 14
   - 0 * 8 = 0
   - 7 * 9 = 63

3. Sum these products:
   0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 48 + 14 + 0 + 63 = 125

4. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum:
   125 % 11 = 4

5. Compute the check digit:
   11 - 4 = 7

Therefore, the check digit for the Tropicos ID 8207, if it were an ISBN-10 number, is **7**.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).

First, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since the density of Freon-12 at such extreme conditions is not readily available, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation. This approximation is reasonable because Freon-12 is a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The ideal gas law is given by:
\[ PV = nRT \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure
- \( V \) is the volume
- \( n \) is the number of moles
- \( R \) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin

First, we need to calculate the number of moles of Freon-12. The molar mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is:
\[ 12.01 \, (\text{C}) + 2 \times 35.45 \, (\text{Cl}) + 2 \times 19.00 \, (\text{F}) = 120.91 \, \text{g/mol} \]

Given mass of Freon-12 is 0.312 kg, which is 312 grams. Therefore, the number of moles \( n \) is:
\[ n = \frac{312 \, \text{g}}{120.91 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2.58 \, \text{mol} \]

Now, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume \( V \):
\[ P = 1100 \, \text{atm} \]
\[ T = 275.15 \, \text{K} \]
\[ R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \]

Rearranging the ideal gas law to solve for \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{nRT}{P} \]
\[ V = \frac{(2.58 \, \text{mol}) \times (0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}) \times (275.15 \, \text{K})}{1100 \, \text{atm}} \]
\[ V \approx \frac{58.36}{1100} \]
\[ V \approx 0.053 \, \text{L} \]

Converting liters to milliliters:
\[ V \approx 0.053 \, \text{L} \times 1000 \, \text{mL/L} \]
\[ V \approx 53 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is:
\[ \boxed{53} \])

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance of your trip:**
   - From Los Angeles, CA to Cincinnati, OH via I-40: approximately 2,200 miles.
   - From Cincinnati, OH to Augusta, ME via I-90: approximately 900 miles.
   - Total distance: 2,200 miles + 900 miles = 3,100 miles.

2. **Determine the number of water bottles consumed:**
   - You drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - Total water bottles for 3,100 miles: \( \frac{3,100 \text{ miles}}{100 \text{ miles}} \times 5 \text{ bottles} = 155 \text{ bottles} \).

3. **Check the recycling refund rates:**
   - According to Wikipedia, the refund rates for recycling water bottles vary by state. The states you will pass through with bottle deposit laws include California, Maine, and possibly others depending on your exact route.
   - California: $0.05 per bottle.
   - Maine: $0.05 per bottle.

4. **Calculate the total refund:**
   - Since you start in California and end in Maine, and both states have a $0.05 refund rate, you can use this rate for simplicity.
   - Total refund: \( 155 \text{ bottles} \times $0.05 \text{ per bottle} = $7.75 \).

Therefore, you will get back **$7.75** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 145: Incorrect (Expected: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Got: To determine the five classes in the group, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Roles and Armor Types:**
   - **Tank:** One of the plate wearers.
   - **Healer:** One of the cloth wearers.
   - **DPS:** Three DPS, with one being a plate wearer and two being cloth wearers.

2. **Spell Types:**
   - **Tank and Healer:** Both are casting holy spells.
   - **DPS:** One uses ice spells, one uses fire spells, and one is a bear (which indicates a Druid in bear form).

3. **Special Abilities:**
   - **Metamorphosis:** This is a Demon Hunter ability.

4. **Loot:**
   - **Kilt of the Forgotten One:** No one can use it, which suggests it is not suitable for any of the classes present.

Given these details, let's identify the classes:

- **Tank:** A plate wearer casting holy spells. This is a Paladin.
- **Healer:** A cloth wearer casting holy spells. This is a Priest.
- **DPS 1:** A plate wearer. Since Metamorphosis is cast, this is a Demon Hunter.
- **DPS 2:** A cloth wearer using ice spells. This is a Mage.
- **DPS 3:** A bear form attacker. This is a Druid.

Now, let's list the classes in alphabetical order:

1. Demon Hunter
2. Druid
3. Mage
4. Paladin
5. Priest

So, the five classes in the group are:

**Demon Hunter, Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest**)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: To determine the difference in the number of unique winners between "Survivor" and "American Idol" as of the end of the 44th season of "Survivor," we need to look at the number of winners for each show.

**Survivor:**
- As of the end of the 44th season, "Survivor" has had 44 unique winners, since each season typically crowns a new winner.

**American Idol:**
- "American Idol" has completed 21 seasons as of 2023. Each season of "American Idol" also typically crowns a new winner, so there have been 21 unique winners.

To find the difference in the number of unique winners:
- Number of unique winners of "Survivor": 44
- Number of unique winners of "American Idol": 21

Difference:
\[ 44 - 21 = 23 \]

So, as of the end of the 44th season of "Survivor," there have been 23 more unique winners of "Survivor" compared to "American Idol.")
