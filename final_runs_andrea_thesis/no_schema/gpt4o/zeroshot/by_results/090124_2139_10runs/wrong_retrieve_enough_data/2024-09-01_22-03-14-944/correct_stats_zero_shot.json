The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8207.\n\nThe ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).\n2. Sum these products.\n3. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum.\n4. The check digit is the result of 11 minus the modulo 11 result. If this result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. If the result is 11, the check digit is 0.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the Tropicos ID 8207:\n\n1. Write the ID as a 9-digit number by padding with leading zeros: 000008207.\n2. Multiply each digit by its position:\n   - 0 * 1 = 0\n   - 0 * 2 = 0\n   - 0 * 3 = 0\n   - 0 * 4 = 0\n   - 0 * 5 = 0\n   - 8 * 6 = 48\n   - 2 * 7 = 14\n   - 0 * 8 = 0\n   - 7 * 9 = 63\n\n3. Sum these products:\n   0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 48 + 14 + 0 + 63 = 125\n\n4. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum:\n   125 % 11 = 4\n\n5.

        "returned_answer": "To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2\u00b0C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since the density of Freon-12 at such extreme conditions is not readily available, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation. This approximation is reasonable because Freon-12 is a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure\n- \\( V \\) is the volume\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K))\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of Freon-12. The molar mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is:\n\\[ 12.01 \\, (\\text{C}) + 2 \\times 35.45 \\, (\\text{Cl}) + 2 \\times 19.00 \\, (\\text{F}) = 120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nGiven mass of Freon-12 is 0.312 kg, which is 312 grams. Therefore, the number of moles \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ n = \\frac{312 \\, \\text{g}}{120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume \\( V \\):\n\\[ P = 1100 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\\[ T = 275.15 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\\[ R = 0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)} \\]\n\nRearranging the ideal gas law to solve for \\( V \\):\n\\[ V = \\frac{nRT}{P} \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{(2.58 \\, \\text{mol}) \\times (0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)}) \\times (275.15 \\, \\text{K})}{1100 \\, \\text{atm}} \\]\n\\[ V \\approx \\frac{58.36}{1100} \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nConverting liters to milliliters:\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mL/L} \\]\n\\[ V \\approx 53 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{53} \\]",
