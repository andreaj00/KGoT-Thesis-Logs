Final Result: content="To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location, specifically the pressure and temperature. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need to find the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. The density of a substance can be affected by both temperature and pressure. However, detailed density data for Freon-12 at such extreme conditions might not be readily available. For the sake of this calculation, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation, though it is not perfectly accurate under such high pressures.\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure (in atm)\n- \\( V \\) is the volume (in liters)\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of Freon-12.

Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it.

Final Result: content="To determine the five classes in the group, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Roles and Armor Types:**\n   - One tank\n   - One healer\n   - Three DPS\n   - Two plate wearers\n   - Two cloth wearers\n\n2. **Abilities and Spells:**\n   - Both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells.\n   - Ice and fire are being used by two different DPS.\n   - A bear is attacking the boss.\n   - Metamorphosis is cast.\n\n3. **Loot:**\n   - The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops, but no one can use it (implying it is not suitable for any of the classes present).\n\n4. **Class Abilities:**\n   - Holy spells are typically cast by Paladins and Priests.\n   - Ice spells are typically cast by Mages (Frost specialization).\n   - Fire spells are typically cast by Mages (Fire specialization) or Warlocks (Destruction specialization).\n   - A bear form is specific to Druids.\n   - Metamorphosis is a spell used by Demon Hunters (tank or DPS) or Warlocks (DPS).\n\nGiven these details, let's deduce the classes:\n\n- **Tank:** The tank is casting holy spells, which means the tank is a Paladin (plate wearer).\n- **Healer:** The healer is also casting holy spells, which means the healer is a Priest (cloth wearer).\n- **DPS 1:** One DPS is using ice spells, which means this DPS is a Mage (cloth wearer).\n- **DPS 2:** One DPS is using fire spells, which could be a Mage or a Warlock. Since we already have a Mage for ice, this DPS is a Warlock (cloth wearer).\n- **DPS 3:** A bear is attacking the boss, which means this DPS is a Druid (leather wearer).\n\nSince Metamorphosis is mentioned, it could be a Demon Hunter or a Warlock. Given that we already have a Warlock for fire spells, the Metamorphosis here is likely from a Demon Hunter (leather wearer). However, since we need to account for the bear form, the Druid is the one in bear form, and the Metamorphosis is from the Warlock.\n\nTherefore, the classes in the group are:\n\n1. Paladin (Tank, Plate)\n2. Priest (Healer, Cloth)\n3. Mage (DPS, Cloth)\n4. Warlock (DPS, Cloth)\n5.
