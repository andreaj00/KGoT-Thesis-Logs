</attached_docs>
Row 26: Incorrect (Expected: Li Peng, Got: To determine which contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet, we need to identify both the contributors to that version of OpenCV and the names of former Chinese heads of government.

1. **Former Chinese Heads of Government:**
   - One notable former Chinese head of government is **Wen Jiabao**, who served as the Premier of the People's Republic of China from 2003 to 2013.

2. **Contributors to OpenCV:**
   - We need to look at the list of contributors to the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added. This information is typically available in the release notes or the repository's commit history.

Since I don't have access to the attached documents, I will provide a general approach to finding this information:

- **Step 1:** Identify the version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added. This can be found in the OpenCV release notes or documentation.
- **Step 2:** Check the list of contributors for that version. This can be done by looking at the commit history on the OpenCV GitHub repository or the contributors listed in the release notes.

If you have access to the specific version and the list of contributors, you can compare the names to see if any match "Wen Jiabao" or a similar transliteration.

For example, if the version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added is 4.1.0, you would:

- Go to the [OpenCV GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).
- Navigate to the commit history around the release date of version 4.1.0.
- Look for contributors' names in the commit messages or the contributors' list.

If you find a contributor named "Wen Jiabao" or a similar transliteration, that would be the person you are looking for.)

Docs: []
Query with Attached Docs: Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for the Tropicos ID of the Order Helotiales as if it were an ISBN-10 number, we need to follow the ISBN-10 check digit calculation method. The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8207.

The ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:

1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).
2. Sum these products.
3. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum.
4. The check digit is the result of 11 minus the modulo result. If the result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. If the result is 11, the check digit is '0'.

Let's apply these steps to the Tropicos ID 8207:

1. Write the ID as a 9-digit number by padding with leading zeros: 000008207.
2. Multiply each digit by its position:
   - 0 * 1 = 0
   - 0 * 2 = 0
   - 0 * 3 = 0
   - 0 * 4 = 0
   - 0 * 5 = 0
   - 8 * 6 = 48
   - 2 * 7 = 14
   - 0 * 8 = 0
   - 7 * 9 = 63

3. Sum these products:
   0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 48 + 14 + 0 + 63 = 125

4. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum:
   125 % 11 = 4

5. Compute the check digit:
   11 - 4 = 7

Therefore, the check digit for the Tropicos ID 8207, if it were an ISBN-10 number, is **7**.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location, specifically the pressure and temperature. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).

First, we need to find the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. The density of a substance can be affected by both temperature and pressure. However, detailed density data for Freon-12 at such extreme conditions might not be readily available. For the sake of this calculation, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation, though it is not perfectly accurate under such high pressures.

The ideal gas law is given by:
\[ PV = nRT \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure (in atm)
- \( V \) is the volume (in liters)
- \( n \) is the number of moles
- \( R \) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))
- \( T \) is the temperature (in Kelvin)

First, we need to calculate the number of moles of Freon-12. The molar mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is:
\[ 12.01 + 2 \times 35.45 + 2 \times 18.998 = 120.91 \text{ g/mol} \]

Given mass of Freon-12:
\[ 0.312 \text{ kg} = 312 \text{ g} \]

Number of moles (\( n \)):
\[ n = \frac{312 \text{ g}}{120.91 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 2.58 \text{ mol} \]

Now, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume:
\[ V = \frac{nRT}{P} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ V = \frac{2.58 \text{ mol} \times 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(mol·K)} \times 275.15 \text{ K}}{1100 \text{ atm}} \]

\[ V \approx \frac{58.36}{1100} \]

\[ V \approx 0.053 L \]

Converting liters to milliliters:
\[ 0.053 \text{ L} \times 1000 \text{ mL/L} = 53 \text{ mL} \]

Therefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is:
\[ \boxed{53} \])

Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance of your trip:**
   - From Los Angeles, CA to Cincinnati, OH via I-40: approximately 2,200 miles.
   - From Cincinnati, OH to Augusta, ME via I-90: approximately 900 miles.
   - Total distance: 2,200 miles + 900 miles = 3,100 miles.

2. **Determine the number of 100-mile segments:**
   - Total distance: 3,100 miles.
   - Number of 100-mile segments: 3,100 miles / 100 miles per segment = 31 segments.

3. **Calculate the total number of water bottles consumed:**
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - Total water bottles: 31 segments * 5 water bottles per segment = 155 water bottles.

4. **Determine the recycling refund:**
   - According to Wikipedia, the refund value for recycling water bottles varies by state. For simplicity, let's assume an average refund value of $0.05 per bottle, which is common in many states with bottle deposit laws.

5. **Calculate the total refund:**
   - Total refund: 155 water bottles * $0.05 per bottle = $7.75.

Therefore, you will get back approximately $7.75 from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 136: Incorrect (Expected: 519, Got: I'm sorry, but I can't access or view attachments. However, I can provide information based on historical data. The New York Yankees player with the most walks in the 1977 regular season was Reggie Jackson, who had 86 walks. To find out how many at-bats he had that season, you can refer to historical baseball statistics databases or records.

According to available historical data, Reggie Jackson had 527 at-bats during the 1977 regular season. If you need more detailed statistics or information, I recommend checking a reliable sports statistics website or database.)



Solving question 145:
Query: A 5-man group made up of one tank, one healer, and three DPS is doing a dungeon that was just released in World of Warcraft. Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?

Row 145: Incorrect (Expected: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Got: To determine the five classes in the group, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Roles and Armor Types:**
   - One tank
   - One healer
   - Three DPS
   - Two plate wearers
   - Two cloth wearers

2. **Abilities and Spells:**
   - Both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells.
   - Ice and fire are being used by two different DPS.
   - A bear is attacking the boss.
   - Metamorphosis is cast.

3. **Loot:**
   - The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops, but no one can use it (implying it is not suitable for any of the classes present).

4. **Class Abilities:**
   - Holy spells are typically cast by Paladins and Priests.
   - Ice spells are typically cast by Mages (Frost specialization).
   - Fire spells are typically cast by Mages (Fire specialization) or Warlocks (Destruction specialization).
   - A bear form is specific to Druids.
   - Metamorphosis is a spell used by Demon Hunters (tank or DPS) or Warlocks (DPS).

Given these details, let's deduce the classes:

- **Tank:** The tank is casting holy spells, which means the tank is a Paladin (plate wearer).
- **Healer:** The healer is also casting holy spells, which means the healer is a Priest (cloth wearer).
- **DPS 1:** One DPS is using ice spells, which means this DPS is a Mage (cloth wearer).
- **DPS 2:** One DPS is using fire spells, which could be a Mage or a Warlock. Since we already have a Mage for ice, this DPS is a Warlock (cloth wearer).
- **DPS 3:** A bear is attacking the boss, which means this DPS is a Druid (leather wearer).

Since Metamorphosis is mentioned, it could be a Demon Hunter or a Warlock. Given that we already have a Warlock for fire spells, the Metamorphosis here is likely from a Demon Hunter (leather wearer). However, since we need to account for the bear form, the Druid is the one in bear form, and the Metamorphosis is from the Warlock.

Therefore, the classes in the group are:

1. Paladin (Tank, Plate)
2. Priest (Healer, Cloth)
3. Mage (DPS, Cloth)
4. Warlock (DPS, Cloth)
5. Druid (DPS, Leather)

In alphabetical order, the classes are:

**Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Warlock**)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of "Survivor," there have been 44 unique winners, as each season typically crowns a new winner.

For "American Idol," as of the end of its 21st season, there have been 21 unique winners, as each season also typically crowns a new winner.

To find the difference in the number of unique winners between "Survivor" and "American Idol":

- "Survivor" has 44 unique winners.
- "American Idol" has 21 unique winners.

The difference is:
44 (Survivor) - 21 (American Idol) = 23

So, there have been 23 more unique winners of "Survivor" compared to "American Idol.")
