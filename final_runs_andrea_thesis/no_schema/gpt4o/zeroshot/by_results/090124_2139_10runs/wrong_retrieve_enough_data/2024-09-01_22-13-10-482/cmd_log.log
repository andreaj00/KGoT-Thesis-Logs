Row 26: Incorrect (Expected: Li Peng, Got: I don't have access to the attached documents, but I can provide some general information that might help you. The former Chinese head of government you are referring to is likely Wen Jiabao, who served as the Premier of the People's Republic of China from 2003 to 2013.

To find out if there is a contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model with the same name, you would need to look at the list of contributors for that specific version of OpenCV. This information is typically available in the project's repository, such as on GitHub, in the release notes, or in the contributors' section.

If you have access to the repository or the release notes for the version of OpenCV that added support for the Mask-RCNN model, you can search for the name "Wen Jiabao" or similar transliterations to see if there is a match.)

Row 28: Incorrect (Expected: Fred, Got: To determine who did not give a gift, we need to match each gift to the recipient's interests and then check if any employee did not give a gift.

First, let's match the gifts to the recipients based on their interests:

1. **Galileo Galilei biography** - This would likely go to someone interested in Astronomy, which matches **Miguel**.
2. **Fishing reel** - This matches **Harry**'s interest in Fishing.
3. **Raku programming guide** - This is a bit tricky, but since Raku is a programming language, it might be related to **Fred**'s interest in Perl.
4. **Chisel set** - This matches **Jun**'s interest in Woodworking.
5. **Custom dice** - This matches **Sara**'s interest in Tabletop RPGs.
6. **“War and Peace” American film copy** - This matches **Perry**'s interest in Old Movies.
7. **Yarn** - This matches **Micah**'s interest in Knitting.
8. **“One Piece” graphic novel** - This matches **Alex**'s interest in Manga.
9. **“War and Peace” novel** - This could match **Tyson**'s interest in Historical Fiction Novels.
10. **Starbucks gift card** - This matches **Lucy**'s interest in Coffee.
11. **Foam exercise mat** - This matches **Georgette**'s interest in Yoga.

Now, let's check the gift assignments to see if any employee did not give a gift:

1. **Harry** gave a gift to **Miguel**.
2. **Rebecca** gave a gift to **Micah**.
3. **Georgette** gave a gift to **Lucy**.
4. **Micah** gave a gift to **Jun**.
5. **Perry** gave a gift to **Georgette**.
6. **Tyson** gave a gift to **Fred**.
7. **Lucy** gave a gift to **Alex**.
8. **Jun** gave a gift to **Harry**.
9. **Sara** gave a gift to **Perry**.
10. **Fred** gave a gift to **Rebecca**.
11. **Miguel** gave a gift to **Sara**.
12. **Alex** was supposed to give a gift to **Tyson**.

Since only eleven gifts were given, and we have accounted for all the gifts except one, it means **Alex** did not give a gift to **Tyson**.)

Docs: []
Query with Attached Docs: Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for the Tropicos ID of the Order Helotiales as if it were an ISBN-10 number, we need to follow the ISBN-10 check digit calculation method. The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8207.

The ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:

1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).
2. Sum these products.
3. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum.
4. The check digit is the result of 11 minus the modulo result. If the result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. If the result is 11, the check digit is '0'.

Let's apply these steps to the Tropicos ID 8207:

1. Write the ID as a 9-digit number by padding with leading zeros: 000008207.
2. Multiply each digit by its position:
   - 0 * 1 = 0
   - 0 * 2 = 0
   - 0 * 3 = 0
   - 0 * 4 = 0
   - 0 * 5 = 0
   - 8 * 6 = 48
   - 2 * 7 = 14
   - 0 * 8 = 0
   - 7 * 9 = 63

3. Sum these products:
   0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 48 + 14 + 0 + 63 = 125

4. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum:
   125 % 11 = 4

5. Compute the check digit:
   11 - 4 = 7

Therefore, the check digit for the Tropicos ID 8207, if it were an ISBN-10 number, is **7**.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2°C (275.15 K).

First, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since we don't have the exact density at 1100 atm and 2°C, we can use the general properties of Freon-12 and make some approximations.

Freon-12 has a critical temperature of 111.97°C and a critical pressure of 41.13 atm. At standard conditions (1 atm and 25°C), the density of Freon-12 is approximately 1.311 g/cm³. However, under high pressure, the density will be significantly higher.

Given the high pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we can assume that Freon-12 will be in a liquid state, and its density will be close to that of a liquid under high pressure. For simplicity, let's assume the density of liquid Freon-12 under these conditions is approximately 1.5 g/cm³ (this is a rough estimate, as the exact value would require detailed thermodynamic data).

Now, we can calculate the volume:

1. Convert the mass of Freon-12 to grams:
   \[
   0.312 \text{ kg} = 312 \text{ g}
   \]

2. Use the density to find the volume:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{312 \text{ g}}{1.5 \text{ g/cm}^3} = 208 \text{ cm}^3
   \]

3. Convert cubic centimeters to milliliters (1 cm³ = 1 mL):
   \[
   208 \text{ cm}^3 = 208 \text{ mL}
   \]

Therefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is 208 mL.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance of your trip:**
   - From Los Angeles, CA to Cincinnati, OH via I-40: approximately 2,200 miles.
   - From Cincinnati, OH to Augusta, ME via I-90: approximately 900 miles.
   - Total distance: 2,200 miles + 900 miles = 3,100 miles.

2. **Determine the number of 100-mile segments:**
   - Total distance: 3,100 miles.
   - Number of 100-mile segments: 3,100 miles / 100 miles per segment = 31 segments.

3. **Calculate the total number of water bottles consumed:**
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - Total water bottles: 31 segments * 5 water bottles per segment = 155 water bottles.

4. **Determine the recycling refund:**
   - According to Wikipedia, the refund value for recycling water bottles varies by state. For simplicity, let's assume an average refund value of $0.05 per bottle, which is common in many states with bottle deposit laws.

5. **Calculate the total refund:**
   - Total refund: 155 water bottles * $0.05 per bottle = $7.75.

Therefore, you will get back approximately $7.75 from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 145: Incorrect (Expected: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Got: To determine the five classes in the group, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Roles and Armor Types:**
   - **Tank:** One of the plate wearers.
   - **Healer:** One of the cloth wearers.
   - **DPS:** Three DPS, with one being a plate wearer and two being cloth wearers.

2. **Spell Types:**
   - **Tank and Healer:** Both are casting holy spells.
   - **DPS:** One uses ice spells, another uses fire spells, and a bear is attacking the boss.

3. **Class Abilities:**
   - **Bear Form:** This is a Druid ability.
   - **Metamorphosis:** This is a Demon Hunter ability.

4. **Loot:**
   - **Kilt of the Forgotten One:** No one can use it, implying it is likely a piece of gear that none of the present classes can equip.

5. **Class Identification:**
   - **Tank (Plate, Holy Spells):** Paladin (Paladins can tank and cast holy spells).
   - **Healer (Cloth, Holy Spells):** Priest (Priests can heal and cast holy spells).
   - **DPS (Ice Spells):** Mage (Mages can cast ice spells).
   - **DPS (Fire Spells):** Warlock (Warlocks can cast fire spells).
   - **DPS (Bear Form):** Druid (Druids can shapeshift into a bear).

6. **Metamorphosis:** This is a Demon Hunter ability, but since we already have identified all roles and the classes fit the given criteria, it seems there might be a mistake in the initial interpretation. However, since the classes must be unique and fit the roles, we will proceed with the identified classes.

7. **Kilt of the Forgotten One:** This is likely a piece of gear for a class not present in the group, such as a Shaman or a Monk.

Given the above analysis, the five classes in the group are:

- Druid (Bear Form DPS)
- Mage (Ice DPS)
- Paladin (Tank)
- Priest (Healer)
- Warlock (Fire DPS)

In alphabetical order, the classes are:

**Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Warlock**)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of "Survivor," there have been 44 unique winners, as each season typically crowns a new winner.

For "American Idol," as of the end of its 21st season, there have been 21 unique winners, as each season also typically crowns a new winner.

To find the difference in the number of unique winners between "Survivor" and "American Idol":

- "Survivor" has 44 unique winners.
- "American Idol" has 21 unique winners.

The difference is:
44 (Survivor) - 21 (American Idol) = 23

So, there have been 23 more unique winners of "Survivor" compared to "American Idol.")
