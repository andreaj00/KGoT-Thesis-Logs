This information is often available in the repository's commit history, release notes, or contributors file.\n\n3. **Match the Names**: Compare the names of the contributors to the names of former Chinese heads of government. Some notable former Chinese heads of government include:\n   - Zhou Enlai\n   - Li Peng\n   - Zhu Rongji\n   - Wen Jiabao\n   - Li Keqiang\n\nFor example, if a contributor's name is \"Zhou Enlai\" or \"Li Peng,\" it would match the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\nIf you can provide more specific details or access to the documents, I could give a more precise answer.",

The ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using a weighted sum of the first 9 digits, with weights decreasing from 10 to 2, and then taking the modulus 11 of the sum. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Check digit} = (10 \\cdot d_1 + 9 \\cdot d_2 + 8 \\cdot d_3 + 7 \\cdot d_4 + 6 \\cdot d_5 + 5 \\cdot d_6 + 4 \\cdot d_7 + 3 \\cdot d_8 + 2 \\cdot d_9) \\mod 11 \\]\n\nIf the result is 10, the check digit is represented as 'X'.\n\nFirst, we need the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales. Since I don't have access to the attached documents, I'll assume you have the Tropicos ID. Let's say the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is \"123456789\" (you should replace this with the actual ID).\n\nLet's compute the check digit for the ID \"123456789\":\n\n1. Multiply each digit by its weight:\n   \\[\n   10 \\cdot 1 + 9 \\cdot 2 + 8 \\cdot 3 + 7 \\cdot 4 + 6 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 6 + 4 \\cdot 7 + 3 \\cdot 8 + 2 \\cdot 9\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate each term:\n   \\[\n   10 \\cdot 1 = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9 \\cdot 2 = 18\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3 = 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7 \\cdot 4 = 28\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\cdot 5 = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 6 = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4 \\cdot 7 = 28\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 9 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Sum these values:\n   \\[\n   10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 30 + 30 + 28 + 24 + 18 = 210\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute the modulus 11 of the sum:\n   \\[\n   210 \\mod 11 = 1\n   \\]\n\nSo, the check digit for the Tropicos ID \"123456789\" as an ISBN-10 number would be 1.\n\nPlease replace \"123456789\" with the actual Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales to get the correct check digit.",

The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2\u00b0C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since the density of Freon-12 at such extreme conditions is not readily available, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation. This approximation is reasonable because Freon-12 is a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure (in atm)\n- \\( V \\) is the volume (in liters)\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K))\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature (in Kelvin)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of Freon-12. The molar mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is:\n\\[ 12.01 \\, (\\text{C}) + 2 \\times 35.45 \\, (\\text{Cl}) + 2 \\times 19.00 \\, (\\text{F}) = 120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nGiven mass of Freon-12:\n\\[ 0.312 \\, \\text{kg} = 312 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nNumber of moles (\\( n \\)):\n\\[ n = \\frac{312 \\, \\text{g}}{120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume:\n\\[ V = \\frac{nRT}{P} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ P = 1100 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\\[ T = 275.15 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\\[ R = 0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)} \\]\n\\[ n = 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K)} \\times 275.15 \\, \\text{K}}{1100 \\, \\text{atm}} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx \\frac{58.36}{1100} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nConverting to milliliters:\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mL/L} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 53 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{53} \\]",

The most common refund values are $0.05 or $0.10 per bottle, depending on the state.\n\nSince you are traveling across multiple states, let's assume the average refund value is $0.05 per bottle (a common value in many states).\n\n5. **Calculate the total refund amount:**\n   - Total refund: 155 bottles * $0.05/bottle = $7.75.\n\nTherefore, you will get back approximately $7.75 from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.",
