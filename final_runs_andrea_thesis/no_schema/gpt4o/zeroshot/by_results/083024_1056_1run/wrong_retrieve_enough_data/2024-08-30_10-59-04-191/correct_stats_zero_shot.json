The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 8207.\n\nThe ISBN-10 check digit is calculated using the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply each of the first 9 digits by its position (i.e., the first digit by 1, the second digit by 2, and so on).\n2. Sum these products.\n3. Compute the modulo 11 of the sum.\n4. The check digit is the result of 11 minus the modulo 11 result. If this result is 10, the check digit is 'X'. If the result is 11, the check digit is '0'.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the Tropicos ID 8207:\n\n1. Write the ID as a 9-digit number by padding with leading zeros: 000008207.\n2. Multiply each digit by its position:\n   - 0 * 1 = 0\n   - 0 * 2 = 0\n   - 0 * 3 = 0\n   - 0 * 4 = 0\n   - 0 * 5 = 0\n   - 8 * 6 = 48\n   - 2 * 7 = 14\n   - 0 * 8 = 0\n   - 7 * 9 = 63\n\n3.

        "returned_answer": "To determine the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to consider the conditions at that location. The Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, with a depth of about 11,000 meters. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1100 atmospheres (atm), and the temperature is around 2\u00b0C (275.15 K).\n\nFirst, we need the density of Freon-12 under these conditions. However, since the density of Freon-12 at such extreme conditions is not readily available, we will use the ideal gas law as an approximation. This approximation is not perfect due to the high pressure, but it will give us a reasonable estimate.\n\nThe ideal gas law is given by:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure in atmospheres (atm)\n- \\( V \\) is the volume in liters (L)\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles\n- \\( R \\) is the ideal gas constant, \\( R = 0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm\u00b7K}^{-1}\\text{\u00b7mol}^{-1} \\)\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin (K)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (\\( n \\)) of Freon-12. The molar mass of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is:\n\\[ 12.01 \\, (\\text{C}) + 2 \\times 35.45 \\, (\\text{Cl}) + 2 \\times 19.00 \\, (\\text{F}) = 120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nGiven mass of Freon-12:\n\\[ 0.312 \\, \\text{kg} = 312 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nNumber of moles (\\( n \\)):\n\\[ n = \\frac{312 \\, \\text{g}}{120.91 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume (\\( V \\)):\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{nRT}{P} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ P = 1100 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\\[ T = 275.15 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\\[ n = 2.58 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\\[ R = 0.0821 \\, \\text{L\u00b7atm\u00b7K}^{-1}\\text{\u00b7mol}^{-1} \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{2.58 \\times 0.0821 \\times 275.15}{1100} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx \\frac{58.36}{1100} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nConverting to milliliters (1 L = 1000 mL):\n\\[ V \\approx 0.053 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mL/L} \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 53 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest milliliter, is approximately:\n\\[ \\boxed{53} \\]",

However, since we need unique classes, let's consider the Warlock.\n- **DPS 3:** A bear is attacking the boss, which means this DPS is a Druid (Feral specialization).\n\nNow, let's check the armor types:\n- **Plate wearers:** Paladin (Tank) and one other class.\n- **Cloth wearers:** Priest (Healer) and one other class.\n- **Leather wearers:** Druid (Bear form).\n\nSince the Kilt of the Forgotten One is not usable by anyone in the group, it suggests that the remaining classes do not wear kilts (which are typically cloth or leather).\n\nGiven the unique classes and the armor types:\n- **Paladin (Tank) - Plate**\n- **Priest (Healer) - Cloth**\n- **Mage (Frost DPS) - Cloth**\n- **Warlock (Fire DPS) - Cloth**\n- **Druid (Bear DPS) - Leather**\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we have two plate wearers.

The Kilt of the Forgotten One is likely a cloth item, which the Mage and Priest could use, but since it says no one can use it, it might be a specific type of cloth item not suitable for their specs.\n\nTherefore, the five classes in alphabetical order are:\n- **Demon Hunter, Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest**",
