        "returned_answer": "To determine how many thousand hours it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the minimum perigee distance of the Moon from Earth.**\n2. **Determine Kipchoge's marathon pace.**\n3. **Calculate the time it would take to cover the distance at that pace.**\n4. **Convert the time into thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours.**\n\n### Step 1: Minimum Perigee Distance\nAccording to the Wikipedia page for the Moon, the minimum perigee distance (closest approach) is approximately 356,500 km.\n\n### Step 2: Kipchoge's Marathon Pace\nEliud Kipchoge's marathon world record is 2:01:39 (2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds) for a distance of 42.195 kilometers.\n\nFirst, convert the marathon time into hours:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60} + \\frac{39 \\text{ seconds}}{3600} = 2 + \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{39}{3600} \\approx 2.0275 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, calculate his pace in km/h:\n\\[ \\text{Pace} = \\frac{42.195 \\text{ km}}{2.0275 \\text{ hours}} \\approx 20.81 \\text{ km/h} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Cover the Distance\nNow, calculate the time it would take to run 356,500 km at a pace of 20.81 km/h:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{356,500 \\text{ km}}{20.81 \\text{ km/h}} \\approx 17128.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert to Thousand Hours and Round\nConvert the time into thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours:\n\\[ 17128.5 \\text{ hours} \\approx 17000 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately **17000** thousand hours for Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, rounded to the nearest 1000 hours.",
