        "returned_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to consider the concept of the false positive rate, which is directly related to the p-value threshold used for determining significance.\n\nA p-value of 0.04 means that there is a 4% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This implies that if the null hypothesis is true, 4% of the studies would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis due to random chance alone.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( N \\) as the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.\n- \\( p \\) as the p-value threshold, which is 0.04 in this case.\n\nThe number of incorrect papers (false positives) can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{False Positives} = N \\times p \\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\text{False Positives (rounded up)} = \\lceil N \\times p \\rceil \\]\n\nWithout the exact number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we can't compute the exact number of false positives. However, if we assume \\( N \\) is known, you can plug in the value to get the result.\n\nFor example, if Nature published 1,000 articles in 2020:\n\\[ \\text{False Positives} = 1000 \\times 0.04 = 40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{False Positives (rounded up)} = \\lceil 40 \\rceil = 40 \\]\n\nIf Nature published 1,234 articles in 2020:\n\\[ \\text{False Positives} = 1234 \\times 0.04 = 49.36 \\]\n\\[ \\text{False Positives (rounded up)} = \\lceil 49.36 \\rceil = 50 \\]\n\nTo summarize, the number of incorrect papers due to false positives can be calculated using the formula \\( \\lceil N \\times 0.04 \\rceil \\), where \\( N \\) is the total number of articles published.",

(AAPL) has undergone several stock splits in its history, which can make it challenging to track the stock price without adjusting for these splits. \n\nTo find the first year Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits, you would need to look at historical stock price data. Apple had a 2-for-1 stock split on June 16, 1987, a 2-for-1 split on June 21, 2000, a 2-for-1 split on February 28, 2005, a 7-for-1 split on June 9, 2014, and a 4-for-1 split on August 31, 2020.\n\nGiven these splits, the stock price would have been significantly higher before each split. For example, before the 7-for-1 split in 2014, the stock price was around $645, which would be approximately $92 after the split. \n\nIf you are looking for the specific year the stock first went above $50 without adjusting for splits, you would need to look at historical data from the 1980s or early 1990s. Based on historical records, Apple stock first went above $50 in the late 1990s, specifically around 1999, before the 2000 stock split.\n\nFor precise information, you would need to consult detailed historical stock price records from a reliable financial data source like Google Finance or another financial database.",

However, I can provide some general information about how Connected Papers works and what might cause a node (or bubble) to be larger in their graph.\n\nConnected Papers is a tool used to visualize the academic literature around a specific paper. It creates a graph where each node represents a paper, and the size of the node can be influenced by several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Citation Count**: Larger nodes often represent papers that have been cited more frequently. A high citation count indicates that the paper has had a significant impact on its field.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The algorithm might also consider the relevance of the paper to the central topic or the query paper. More relevant papers might be represented with larger nodes.\n\n3. **Connections**: The number of connections or edges a node has with other nodes can also influence its size. A paper that is highly interconnected with many other papers in the graph might be represented with a larger node.\n\n4. **Publication Venue**: Sometimes, papers published in high-impact journals or conferences might be given more prominence.\n\nIf you are referring to a specific feature in the DeepFruits fruit detection graph from 2016, it is likely that the largest bubble represents a highly cited and influential paper in the field of fruit detection using deep learning techniques. This paper might have introduced a novel method, dataset, or achieved state-of-the-art results, making it a cornerstone for subsequent research.\n\nFor precise information, you would need to look at the specific details provided by Connected Papers for that graph, such as citation counts, the number of connections, and other metadata associated with the nodes.",

It states that there are approximately 1.42 million breeding pairs of chinstrap penguins.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Breeding Pairs to Individuals\n- Since each breeding pair consists of two penguins, we can calculate the total number of individuals from the breeding pairs:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total individuals} = 1.42 \\text{ million pairs} \\times 2 = 2.84 \\text{ million individuals}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Absolute Difference\n- Now, we need to find the absolute difference between the two population estimates:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Absolute difference} = |8 \\text{ million} - 2.84 \\text{ million}| = 5.16 \\text{ million}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert to Tens of Thousands\n- To express this difference in tens of thousands, we divide by 10,000:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Difference in tens of thousands} = \\frac{5.16 \\text{ million}}{10,000} = 516\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins as of the end of 2018 on the Wikipedia page and the population recorded in the Nature.com article from 2020 is **516 tens of thousands**.",
