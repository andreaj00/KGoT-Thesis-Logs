Row 164: Incorrect (Expected: 1:41.614, Got: To find the world record time for the specific racetrack in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023, you would need to refer to a reliable source that tracks these records, such as the official Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leaderboards or a dedicated speedrunning community like Speedrun.com.

However, since I don't have access to external databases or the ability to browse the internet in real-time, I can't provide the exact world record time. Typically, these records are maintained and updated frequently by the gaming community.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest records on Speedrun.com or similar websites that track Mario Kart 8 Deluxe world records.)
