        "returned_answer": "To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game \"Pick That Ping-Pong,\" you need to consider the mechanics of the game and the random nature of the piston firings. The key is to understand the sequence in which the balls are ejected and how the positions on the platform change over time.\n\nGiven the rules:\n1. The ramp starts with balls numbered 1 to 100 in ascending order.\n2. The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are initially on the platform.\n3. One of the three pistons randomly fires, ejecting the ball in its position.\n4. The positions of the balls on the platform change based on which ball is ejected.\n\nThe goal is to determine which ball has the highest probability of being ejected. Since the pistons fire randomly, each ball on the platform has an equal chance of being ejected at each stage. However, the sequence in which balls are ejected and replaced affects the overall probability of each ball being ejected.\n\nTo maximize your odds, you should choose a ball that is likely to spend the most time on the platform, thereby increasing its chances of being ejected. The ball that fits this criterion is the ball that starts in the first position and has the highest probability of being ejected first.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n- The first ball (1) is in the first position initially.\n- If the first piston fires, ball 1 is ejected, and ball 2 moves to the first position.\n- If the second piston fires, ball 2 is ejected, and ball 3 moves to the first position.\n- If the third piston fires, ball 3 is ejected, and ball 4 moves to the first position.\n\nGiven this sequence, the ball that starts in the first position (ball 1) has the highest probability of being ejected first because it is initially in the first position and will be ejected if the first piston fires.\n\nTherefore, to maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose ball number 1.",

In the Babylonian system, this combination represents the number 60. \n\n#### Symbol 2: \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a\nThis symbol is a combination of one vertical wedge (\ud809\udc10) and one corner wedge (\ud809\udc1a). In the Babylonian system, this combination represents the number 11 (1 + 10).\n\n### Combining the Values:\nIn the Babylonian system, the position of the symbols is crucial, as it determines the value based on the base-60 system. However, in this case, we have two distinct symbols that we can interpret as separate values to be added together.\n\n- \ud809\udc1c = 60\n- \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a = 11\n\nAdding these values together:\n\n\\[ 60 + 11 = 71 \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe given symbols \ud809\udc1c \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a represent the number 71 in Arabic numerals.",

        "returned_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given and deduce the colors of the removed cube. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Cube Types and Counts**:\n   - 6 center cubes (one colored face each)\n   - 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each)\n   - 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each)\n\n2. **Found Cubes**:\n   - All blue cubes are found.\n   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube are found, along with the orange center cube.\n   - All green corners are found.\n   - All green cubes that border yellow are found.\n   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face\u2019s cubes are found.\n\n3. **Removed Cube**:\n   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces (an edge cube).\n\nGiven that all blue cubes are found, the removed cube cannot have blue as one of its colors.\n\nNext, consider the orange center cube and the cubes directly adjacent to it. Since these cubes are found, the removed cube cannot be one of these.\n\nSince all green corners are found, the removed cube cannot be a green corner cube. Additionally, all green cubes that border yellow are found, so the removed cube cannot be one of these either.\n\nFor all orange cubes found, the opposite face\u2019s cubes are also found. This means that if an orange cube is found, the cube on the opposite face (which would be red, since orange and red are opposite) is also found.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's deduce the possible colors for the removed cube:\n\n- The removed cube is an edge cube (two colored faces).\n- It cannot have blue.\n- It cannot be adjacent to the orange center cube.\n- It cannot be a green corner or a green cube bordering yellow.\n- It cannot be an orange cube or a cube opposite an orange cube (which would be red).\n\nThe only remaining edge cubes that fit these criteria are those that do not involve blue, green, or orange. The possible colors left are red, white, and yellow.\n\nSince the removed cube has two colors and must be an edge cube, we need to find a combination of two colors from red, white, and yellow that fits the criteria.\n\nConsidering the constraints, the removed cube must be the edge cube with the colors red and white.\n\nThus, the colors of the removed cube are:\n\n**red, white**",
