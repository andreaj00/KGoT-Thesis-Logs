Solving question 36:

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the connectivity of the green cells in the spreadsheet. Specifically, we need to check if the green cells form a single, continuous loop without any branches or dead ends.

Here are the steps to analyze the situation:

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: List all the coordinates of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that each green cell is connected to at least one other green cell either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

3. **Form a Loop**: Verify if these connected green cells can form a single loop. This means:
   - Each green cell should be part of a continuous path.
   - The path should return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell (no backtracking).

4. **No Dead Ends**: Ensure there are no green cells that are dead ends (i.e., cells that do not lead to another green cell).

Since I don't have the actual spreadsheet to look at, I'll describe how you can manually check this:

### Manual Check

1. **Mark the Green Cells**: On a piece of paper or a digital tool, mark the positions of all green cells.

2. **Trace the Path**: Starting from any green cell, try to trace a path through all the green cells. Ensure you can return to the starting cell without revisiting any cell.

3. **Check for Loops**: If you can trace such a path, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking.

### Example

Let's consider a simple example:

```
A B C D
1 G G G
2 G W G
3 G G G
```

- G represents green cells (Earl's plots).
- W represents white cells (other plots).

In this example, Earl can start at any green cell and walk through all green cells in a loop without backtracking:

1. Start at (1,1).
2. Move to (1,2).
3. Move to (1,3).
4. Move to (2,3).
5. Move to (3,3).
6. Move to (3,2).
7. Move to (3,1).
8. Move to (2,1).
9. Return to (1,1).

This forms a continuous loop.

### Conclusion

If the green cells in your spreadsheet form a similar continuous loop without any dead ends or branches, then Earl can indeed walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If there are any dead ends or if the green cells do not form a single loop, then it is not possible for Earl to do so.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To find the smallest \( n \) where using Newton's Method \( n = n+1 \) after rounding to four decimal places, we need to apply Newton's Method iteratively until the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \).

Newton's Method formula is:
\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \]

First, we need to find the derivative \( f'(x) \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = -5 \):

1. **Iteration 1:**
   \[ x_0 = -5 \]
   \[ f(x_0) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2 \]
   \[ f'(x_0) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375 \]

2. **Iteration 2:**
   \[ x_1 = -4.9375 \]
   \[ f(x_1) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8 \approx -120.5039 + 97.7539 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.0625 \]
   \[ f'(x_1) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.625 \]
   \[ x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = -4.9375 - \frac{0.0625}{30.625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0020 = -4.9395 \]

3. **Iteration 3:**
   \[ x_2 = -4.9395 \]
   \[ f(x_2) = (-4.9395)^3 + 4(-4.9395)^2 - 3(-4.9395) + 8 \approx -120.625 + 97.875 + 14.8185 + 8 = 0.0685 \]
   \[ f'(x_2) = 3(-4.9395)^2 + 8(-4.9395) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.516 - 3 = 30.609 \]
   \[ x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f'(x_2)} = -4.9395 - \frac{0.0685}{30.609} \approx -4.9395 - 0.0022 = -4.9417 \]

4. **Iteration 4:**
   \[ x_3 = -4.9417 \]
   \[ f(x_3) = (-4.9417)^3 + 4(-4.9417)^2 - 3(-4.9417) + 8 \approx -120.75 + 98 + 14.825 + 8 = 0.075 \]
   \[ f'(x_3) = 3(-4.9417)^2 + 8(-4.9417) - 3 \approx 73.125 - 39.533 - 3 = 30.592 \]
   \[ x_4 = x_3 - \frac{f(x_3)}{f'(x_3)} = -4.9417 - \frac{0.075}{30.592} \approx -4.9417 - 0.0025 = -4.9442 \]

We continue this process until the difference between \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \) is less than \( 0.0001 \). 

After several iterations, we find that the difference between \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \) becomes less than \( 0.0001 \) at \( n = 4 \).

Therefore, the smallest \( n \) where the difference between successive approximations is less than \( 0.0001 \) after rounding to four decimal places is \( n = 4 \).)

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code defines a class `Hmm` that generates a random integer between -100 and 100 upon instantiation. The `Yeah` method of this class checks if the generated value is zero. If it is, the method returns `True`; otherwise, it raises a custom exception `UhOh`.

The `Okay` function is a generator that yields instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely. The `keep_trying` function attempts to get an instance of `Hmm` from the generator and checks if its value is zero using the `Yeah` method. If the value is not zero, it catches the `UhOh` exception, prints a message (only on the first try), waits for 0.1 seconds, and then recursively calls itself to try again.

The main block initializes the generator and calls `keep_trying` to start the process. The final numeric output will be the value of the `Hmm` instance that has a value of zero.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what happens when the code runs:

1. The `Okay` generator is initialized.
2. `keep_trying` is called with the generator.
3. Inside `keep_trying`, a new `Hmm` instance is created with a random value between -100 and 100.
4. The `Yeah` method checks if the value is zero.
5. If the value is zero, `Yeah` returns `True`, and `keep_trying` returns the value (which is zero).
6. If the value is not zero, `Yeah` raises an `UhOh` exception.
7. The exception is caught, and if it's the first try, a message is printed.
8. The function waits for 0.1 seconds and then recursively calls itself to try again.

Since the loop continues until a `Hmm` instance with a value of zero is found, the final numeric output will always be `0`.

Therefore, the final numeric output from the attached Python code is:
```
0
