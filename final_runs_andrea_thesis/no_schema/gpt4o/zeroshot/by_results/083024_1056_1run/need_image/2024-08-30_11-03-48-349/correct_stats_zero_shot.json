However, I can guide you on how to find this information.\n\n1. **Identify the Authors**: Look at the list of authors for the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" from 2015.\n\n2. **Check for Prior Publications**: For each author, check their publication history to see if they have authored any papers before 2015.\n\n3. **Find the First Paper**: Once you identify an author with prior publications, look for the earliest paper they authored.\n\nYou can use academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or the ACM Digital Library to search for the authors and their publication histories. Here\u2019s a step-by-step example using Google Scholar:\n\n1. **Search for the Author**: Enter the name of each author in Google Scholar.\n2. **Sort by Date**: Once you find the author\u2019s profile, sort their publications by date to find the earliest one.\n3. **Verify the Title**: Note the title of the earliest paper.\n\nIf you provide the names of the authors, I can give you a more specific example or guide you further.",
