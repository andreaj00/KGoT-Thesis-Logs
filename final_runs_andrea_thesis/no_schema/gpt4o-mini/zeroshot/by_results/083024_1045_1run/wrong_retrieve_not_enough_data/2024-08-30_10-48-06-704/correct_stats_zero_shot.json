        "returned_answer": "To calculate how many thousand hours it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his marathon pace, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the distance from the Earth to the Moon at its closest approach (perigee)**: According to the Wikipedia page, the minimum perigee distance is approximately 363,300 kilometers.\n\n2. **Determine Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace**: Eliud Kipchoge's world record marathon time is 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds, which is approximately 2.0275 hours. The marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers. Therefore, his pace in kilometers per hour (km/h) can be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pace} = \\frac{42.195 \\text{ km}}{2.0275 \\text{ hours}} \\approx 20.82 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time it would take to run the distance to the Moon**: We can use the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{363,300 \\text{ km}}{20.82 \\text{ km/h}} \\approx 17,426.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert hours to thousand hours**: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Thousand hours} = \\frac{17,426.5 \\text{ hours}}{1000} \\approx 17.4265\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the nearest 1000 hours**: Rounding 17.4265 to the nearest whole number gives us 17.\n\nThus, it would take Eliud Kipchoge approximately **17 thousand hours** to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his marathon pace.",

We will count the valid entries (those with complete data).\n\n- Total valid entries (excluding those with missing data): 150\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of penguins that do not live on Dream Island and have beaks longer than 42mm\n\nWe will filter the entries based on the conditions:\n- Island is not \"Dream\"\n- Bill length (beak length) is greater than 42mm\n\nFrom the provided data, we can see that there are no entries with a bill length greater than 42mm. Therefore, the count of penguins that meet these criteria is:\n\n- Count = 0\n\n### Step 3: Find the total penguin population according to the upper estimates on English Wikipedia at the end of 2012\n\nAccording to the upper estimates on English Wikipedia at the end of 2012, the total penguin population is approximately 12 million.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the percentage\n\nNow we can calculate the percentage of the total penguin population made up by the penguins that do not live on Dream Island and have beaks longer than 42mm:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Count of specific penguins}}{\\text{Total penguin population}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0}{12000000} \\right) \\times 100 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe percentage of the total penguin population made up by the penguins in the provided data that do not live on Dream Island and have beaks longer than 42mm is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = 0.00000\\%\n\\]",
