        "returned_answer": "To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Path Connectivity**: Earl must be able to move from one green cell to another without stepping on any non-green cells. This means that all green cells must be connected in such a way that he can traverse them without leaving the green area.\n\n2. **Eulerian Path/Circuit**: For Earl to return to his starting plot without backtracking, the path he takes must form an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit exists in a graph if:\n   - All vertices (in this case, green cells) have an even degree (an even number of connections to other green cells).\n   - All vertices with non-zero degree are connected.\n\n3. **Degree of Cells**: The degree of a cell is determined by how many adjacent green cells it has (up, down, left, right). Earl can only traverse through green cells, so we need to count the degree of each green cell.\n\n4. **Starting Point**: Earl can start at any green cell, but he must ensure that he can return to that cell after visiting all other green cells.\n\nTo solve the problem, you would typically:\n\n- Identify all the green cells and their connections.\n- Count the degree of each green cell.\n- Check if all green cells are connected.\n- Verify if all green cells have an even degree.\n\nIf all conditions are met, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If any of the conditions fail, then it is not possible.\n\nSince I cannot view the attached spreadsheet, you would need to perform this analysis based on the layout of the green cells in your document. If you provide a description of the layout or the degree of the green cells, I can help you further analyze the situation.",

The method `Yeah` checks if `value` is 0 and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.\n\n2. **Generator Function**:\n   - `Okay`: This function is a generator that yields new instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.\n\n3. **Function to Keep Trying**:\n   - `keep_trying`: This function takes a generator and attempts to find a `Hmm` instance where `value` is 0. If it finds such an instance, it returns the value. If it encounters the `UhOh` exception, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.\n\n4. **Main Execution**:\n   - In the `__main__` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying` is called with this generator. The result is printed.\n\n### Final Output\nThe code will keep generating random integers until it finds one that is 0. Since the random integers are uniformly distributed between -100 and 100, the expected output will be `0`, but the time it takes to find it can vary.\n\nThus, the final numeric output from the code will be:\n\n```\n0\n``` \n\nThis output occurs when the `Yeah` method of a `Hmm` instance returns `True`, indicating that the randomly generated `value` is 0.",
