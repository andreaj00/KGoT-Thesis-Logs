Final Result: content="To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to understand the implications of a p-value of 0.04 in the context of statistical significance.\n\nA p-value of 0.04 indicates that there is a 4% probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, a common threshold for statistical significance is p < 0.05. This means that if we set our significance level at 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis for a p-value of 0.04.\n\nHowever, the p-value does not guarantee that the findings are true; it only indicates the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.
