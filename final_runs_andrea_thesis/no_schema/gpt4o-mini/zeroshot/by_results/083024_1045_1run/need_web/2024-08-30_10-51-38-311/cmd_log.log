Solving question 1:
Query: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

Solving question 2:
Query: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance?

Round the value up to the next integer.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 2: Incorrect (Expected: 41, Got: To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to understand the implications of a p-value of 0.04 in the context of statistical significance.

A p-value of 0.04 indicates that there is a 4% probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, a common threshold for statistical significance is p < 0.05. This means that if we set our significance level at 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis for a p-value of 0.04.

However, the p-value does not guarantee that the findings are true; it only indicates the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. The probability of making a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true) is equal to the significance level, which is 0.05 in this case.

If we assume that all articles published in Nature in 2020 relied on statistical significance and had an average p-value of 0.04, we can calculate the expected number of incorrect claims of statistical significance based on the Type I error rate.

1. **Determine the total number of articles**: Let's denote the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020 as \( N \).

2. **Calculate the expected number of incorrect claims**: The expected number of incorrect claims of statistical significance can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Expected incorrect claims} = N \times \text{Type I error rate}
   \]
   Given that the Type I error rate is 0.05, we have:
   \[
   \text{Expected incorrect claims} = N \times 0.05
   \]

3. **Round up to the next integer**: Since we need to round up to the next integer, we will apply the ceiling function to the result.

Without the specific number of articles published by Nature in 2020, we cannot provide a numerical answer. If you can provide the total number of articles published, I can help you calculate the expected number of incorrect claims.)

Row 10: Incorrect (Expected: 86, Got: To determine the percentage of the United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products that have been superseded since the 1959 standards, we would need to analyze the specific items listed in the "dried and dehydrated section" and the Frozen/Chilled section as per your criteria.

1. **Identify the Total Number of Standards**: First, we need to find out how many standards were established in the 1959 document for the specified categories.

2. **Identify Superseded Standards**: Next, we would need to check how many of those standards have been updated or replaced by new versions since 1959.

3. **Calculate the Percentage**: The percentage of superseded standards can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Superseded} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Superseded Standards}}{\text{Total Number of Standards}} \right) \times 100

Row 75: Incorrect (Expected: 0.0424, Got: To calculate the velocity of the reaction using the Michaelis-Menten equation, we can use the following formula:

\[
v = \frac{V_{max} \cdot [S]}{K_m + [S]}
\]

Where:
- \( v \) is the reaction velocity.
- \( V_{max} \) is the maximum reaction velocity (which can be calculated as \( V_{max} = k_{cat} \cdot [E] \), but for simplicity, we will use \( k_{cat} \) directly in this case).
- \( [S] \) is the substrate concentration.
- \( K_m \) is the Michaelis constant.

From Reaction 7, we have:
- Substrate Concentration \([S] = 72.3\)
- Catalytic Constant \(k_{cat} = 0.0429\)
- Menten Constant \(K_m = 0.052\)

Now, substituting these values into the Michaelis-Menten equation:

\[
v = \frac{0.0429 \cdot 72.3}{0.052 + 72.3}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
0.052 + 72.3 = 72.352
\]

Now calculating the numerator:

\[
0.0429 \cdot 72.3 = 3.10347
\]

Now substituting back into the equation for \(v\):

\[
v = \frac{3.10347}{72.352} \approx 0.0429
\]

Calculating the final value:

\[
v \approx 0.0429
\]

Thus, the velocity of the reaction for Reaction 7, rounded to four decimal places, is:

\[
\boxed{0.0429}
\])

Row 141: Incorrect (Expected: 116, Got: To find the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins from the two sources, we need the specific population figures from both the Wikipedia page and the Nature.com article.

1. **Population from Wikipedia (end of 2018)**: Let's assume the population is X (you would need to provide the exact number from the Wikipedia page).
2. **Population from Nature.com (2020)**: Let's assume the population is Y (you would need to provide the exact number from the Nature.com article).

Next, we calculate the absolute difference:

\[
\text{Absolute Difference} = |X - Y|
\]

Then, to find the difference in tens of thousands, we divide the absolute difference by 10,000:

\[
\text{Difference in Tens of Thousands} = \frac{|X - Y|}{10,000}
\]

Finally, we take the absolute value of this result to ensure it is a positive number.
