However, since I don't have access to the Tropicos database or the specific ID, I can't compute the check digit directly.\n\n4. **Final check digit**: After calculating \\(C\\), if \\(C = 10\\), the check digit is 'X'.

However, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the temperature is around 1\u00b0C and the pressure is significantly higher (about 1100 times atmospheric pressure). The density may increase slightly under these conditions, but for simplicity, we can use the room temperature density as an approximation.\n\n2. **Convert the mass of Freon-12 to grams**:\n   \\[\n   0.312 \\text{ kg} = 312 \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the volume using the density**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Density}} = \\frac{312 \\text{ g}}{1.49 \\text{ g/cm}^3} \\approx 209.4 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert cm\u00b3 to mL**: Since 1 cm\u00b3 is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is:\n   \\[\n   209.4 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the nearest mL**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rounded Volume} = 209 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the system comprised of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant when placed at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is **209** mL.",
