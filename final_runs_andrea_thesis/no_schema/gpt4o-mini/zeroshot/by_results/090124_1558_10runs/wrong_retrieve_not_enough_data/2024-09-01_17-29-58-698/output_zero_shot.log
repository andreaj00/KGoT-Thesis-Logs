Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.

Final Result: content="To calculate how many thousand hours it would take Eliud Kipchoge to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his marathon pace, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the distance from the Earth to the Moon at its closest approach (perigee)**: According to the Wikipedia page, the minimum perigee distance is approximately 363,300 kilometers.\n\n2. **Determine Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace**: Eliud Kipchoge's world record marathon time is 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds, which is equivalent to 2.0275 hours. The marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers. Therefore, his pace in kilometers per hour (km/h) can be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pace} = \\frac{42.195 \\text{ km}}{2.0275 \\text{ hours}} \\approx 20.82 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time it would take to run the distance to the Moon**: We can use the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{363,300 \\text{ km}}{20.82 \\text{ km/h}} \\approx 17,426.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert hours to thousand hours**: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Thousand hours} = \\frac{17,426.5 \\text{ hours}}{1000} \\approx 17.4265\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the nearest 1000 hours**: Rounding 17.4265 to the nearest whole number gives us 17.\n\nThus, it would take Eliud Kipchoge approximately **17 thousand hours** to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his marathon pace." response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 417, 'prompt_tokens': 93, 'total_tokens': 510}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9722793223', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-0ba9a2d5-6daa-4ef7-ad13-47462c70a6be-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 93, 'output_tokens': 417, 'total_tokens': 510}

Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.
