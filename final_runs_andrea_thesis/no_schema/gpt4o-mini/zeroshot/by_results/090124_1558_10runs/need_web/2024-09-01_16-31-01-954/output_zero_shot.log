In hypothesis testing, a p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered statistically significant. However, this does not guarantee that the findings are true; it only suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.\n\nIf we assume that the p-value of 0.04 is the average for all articles published in Nature in 2020, we can calculate the expected number of incorrect claims of statistical significance based on the false positive rate.\n\n1. **False Positive Rate**: The false positive rate (Type I error rate) is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
