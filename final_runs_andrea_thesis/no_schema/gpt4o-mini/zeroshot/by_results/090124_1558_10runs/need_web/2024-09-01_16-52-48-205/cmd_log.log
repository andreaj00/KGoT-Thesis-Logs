Solving question 1:
Query: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

Solving question 2:
Query: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance?

Round the value up to the next integer.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 2: Incorrect (Expected: 41, Got: To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to understand the concept of p-values and the common threshold for statistical significance.

A p-value of 0.04 indicates that there is a 4% probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, a common threshold for statistical significance is p < 0.05. However, this does not guarantee that the findings are true; it simply indicates that the results are statistically significant under the null hypothesis.

If we assume that the p-value of 0.04 is the average for all articles published in Nature in 2020, we can calculate the proportion of studies that would be expected to be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance.

1. **Assumption of Null Hypothesis**: If the null hypothesis is true, the expected proportion of studies that would yield a p-value less than 0.05 (and thus be considered statistically significant) is equal to the significance level, which is 5% (0.05).

2. **Calculating Incorrect Claims**: If we assume that all articles published in Nature in 2020 relied on statistical significance to justify their findings, and they averaged a p-value of 0.04, we can calculate the expected number of incorrect claims. 

   - If 5% of studies are expected to be false positives (incorrect claims of significance), we can use this to estimate the number of incorrect claims.

3. **Total Number of Articles**: To proceed, we need the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume there were approximately 1,000 articles published in 2020 (you would need to replace this with the actual number if known).

4. **Calculating Incorrect Claims**:
   - Expected proportion of incorrect claims = 5% of total articles.
   - If there are 1,000 articles, then the expected number of incorrect claims = 0.05 * 1000 = 50.

5. **Rounding Up**: Since the question asks to round up to the next integer, if the calculation yields a non-integer, we would round it up.

Thus, if we assume there were 1,000 articles published in Nature in 2020, we would expect approximately 50 articles to be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance. 

If you have the actual number of articles published in Nature in 2020, you can replace 1,000 with that number to get a more accurate estimate.)

</attached_docs>
Row 10: Incorrect (Expected: 86, Got: To determine the percentage of the United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products that have been superseded since the 1959 standards, we would need to analyze the specific standards listed in the 1959 document and compare them to the current standards as of August 2023.

1. **Identify the Standards from 1959**: We would need to extract the relevant standards from the 1959 document, specifically focusing on the "dried and dehydrated section" and the "Frozen/Chilled section" as specified.

2. **Check for Updates**: Next, we would need to check which of those standards have been updated or superseded since 1959. This would involve looking at the history of the standards and any revisions or new versions that have been published.

3. **Calculate the Percentage**: Once we have the number of original standards and the number that have been superseded, we can calculate the percentage using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Superseded} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Superseded Standards}}{\text{Total Number of Standards}} \right) \times 100
   \]

Since I do not have access to the specific documents or the ability to analyze them directly, I recommend checking the USDA or relevant regulatory body’s website for the most current standards and their history. This will allow you to find the necessary information to perform the calculation accurately.)

1. **Start at the page for "The Lord of the Rings"**: Go to the English Wikipedia page for "The Lord of the Rings (book)."

2. **Identify relevant links**: Look for links within the text that might lead you to related topics, such as "fantasy literature," "J.R.R. Tolkien," or "adaptations."

3. **Follow the links**: Click on the links that seem most relevant to "A Song of Ice and Fire." 

4. **Repeat the process**: Continue clicking on links that lead you closer to "A Song of Ice and Fire," which may include links to "George R.R. Martin," "epic fantasy," or "Game of Thrones."

5. **Count the clicks**: Each link you click counts as one step. Keep track of how many links you click until you reach the "A Song of Ice and Fire" page.

Row 75: Incorrect (Expected: 0.0424, Got: To calculate the velocity of the reaction using the Michaelis-Menten equation, we can use the following formula:

\[
v = \frac{V_{max} \cdot [S]}{K_m + [S]}
\]

Where:
- \( v \) is the reaction velocity,
- \( V_{max} \) is the maximum reaction velocity (which is equal to the catalytic constant \( k \) when the enzyme concentration is constant),
- \( [S] \) is the substrate concentration,
- \( K_m \) is the Michaelis constant.

From Reaction 7, we have the following values:
- Substrate Concentration \([S] = 72.3\)
- Catalytic Constant \(V_{max} = 0.0429\)
- Menten Constant \(K_m = 0.052\)

Now, substituting these values into the Michaelis-Menten equation:

\[
v = \frac{0.0429 \cdot 72.3}{0.052 + 72.3}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
0.052 + 72.3 = 72.352
\]

Now calculating the numerator:

\[
0.0429 \cdot 72.3 = 3.10347
\]

Now substituting back into the equation for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{3.10347}{72.352} \approx 0.0429
\]

Calculating the final value:

\[
v \approx 0.0429
\]

Thus, the velocity of the reaction to four decimal places is:

\[
\boxed{0.0429}
\])

Thus, the integer difference in population between the largest and smallest county seats in Washington state is **93,047**.)

To determine how many times a Twitter/X post was cited as a reference on English Wikipedia pages for each day of August in the last June 2023 versions, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access Wikipedia's Page History**: Go to the Wikipedia page you are interested in and click on the "View history" tab to see the revisions made to the page.

2. **Check the June 2023 Versions**: Look for the versions of the page from June 2023. You can compare different versions to see what references were added or removed.

3. **Search for Twitter/X Links**: In each version, you can search for links that point to Twitter or X. You can do this by using the "Find" function in your web browser (usually Ctrl+F or Command+F) and typing in "twitter.com" or "x.com".

4. **Count the Citations**: For each day in August, you would need to check the relevant pages and count how many times Twitter/X links were cited.

5. **Compile the Data**: Create a table or list to organize the counts for each day of August.

If you have specific pages in mind or need help with a particular aspect of this process, feel free to ask!)
