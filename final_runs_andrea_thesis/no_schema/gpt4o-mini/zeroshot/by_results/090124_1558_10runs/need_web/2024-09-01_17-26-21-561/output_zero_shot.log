In hypothesis testing, a common threshold for statistical significance is p < 0.05. However, this does not guarantee that the findings are true; it simply indicates that the results are statistically significant under the null hypothesis.\n\nIf we assume that the p-value of 0.04 is the average for all articles published in Nature in 2020, we can calculate the proportion of studies that would be expected to be incorrect if we assume that the null hypothesis is true.\n\nThe probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., claiming statistical significance when there is none) is equal to the significance level, which is typically set at 0.05.
