In hypothesis testing, a p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered statistically significant. However, this does not guarantee that the findings are true; it only suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe false discovery rate (FDR) or the proportion of false positives can be estimated using the p-value threshold. If we assume that the null hypothesis is true for a certain proportion of studies, we can estimate how many of the statistically significant results are actually false positives.\n\nIf we assume that the p-value threshold is 0.05, then:\n\n- The probability of a false positive (Type I error) is 0.05.\n- Therefore, if we have a p-value of 0.04, we can still expect that 5% of the studies that claim significance will be incorrect.\n\nTo calculate the number of incorrect claims, we need to know the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.
