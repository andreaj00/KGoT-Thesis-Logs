        "returned_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we need to understand the concept of p-values and the common threshold for statistical significance.\n\nA p-value of 0.04 indicates that there is a 4% probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true. In hypothesis testing, a p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered statistically significant. However, this does not guarantee that the findings are true; it only suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe false discovery rate (FDR) or the proportion of false positives can be estimated using the p-value threshold. If we assume that the null hypothesis is true for a certain proportion of studies, we can estimate how many of the statistically significant results are actually false positives.\n\nIf we assume that the p-value threshold is 0.05, then:\n\n- The probability of a false positive (Type I error) is 0.05.\n- Therefore, if we have a p-value of 0.04, we can still expect that 5% of the studies that claim significance will be incorrect.\n\nTo calculate the number of incorrect claims, we need to know the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020. Since you did not provide that number, I will denote it as \\( N \\).\n\nThe expected number of incorrect claims of statistical significance can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Incorrect Claims} = N \\times 0.05\n\\]\n\nSince we need to round up to the next integer, we would use the ceiling function:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Incorrect Claims} = \\lceil N \\times 0.05 \\rceil\n\\]\n\nIf you provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020, I can give you the exact number of incorrect claims.",
