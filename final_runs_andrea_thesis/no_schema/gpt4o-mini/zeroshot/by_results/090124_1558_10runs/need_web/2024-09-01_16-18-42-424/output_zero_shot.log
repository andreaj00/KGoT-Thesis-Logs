In hypothesis testing, a p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered statistically significant. However, this does not guarantee that the findings are true; it only suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.\n\nIf we assume that the p-value of 0.04 is the average for all articles published in Nature in 2020, we can calculate the number of papers that would be expected to be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance.\n\n1. **Assumption of False Positives**: The probability of a false positive (Type I error) when using a significance level of 0.05 is 5%.
