However, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the temperature is around 1\u00b0C and the pressure is significantly higher (about 1100 times atmospheric pressure). The density of Freon-12 increases under these conditions, but for the sake of this calculation, we can use the density at room temperature as a rough estimate, knowing it will be slightly higher.\n\n2. **Convert mass to grams**: \n   \\[\n   0.312 \\text{ kg} = 312 \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate volume using density**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Density}} = \\frac{312 \\text{ g}}{1.49 \\text{ g/cm}^3} \\approx 209.4 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert cm\u00b3 to mL**: \n   Since 1 cm\u00b3 is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is also approximately 209.4 mL.\n\n5. **Round to the nearest mL**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} \\approx 209 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n209",

However, this can vary by state. For the sake of this calculation, we will assume you are recycling in California and that the same rate applies throughout your trip.\n\n4. **Calculate the total refund**:\n   - Total refund = Number of bottles \u00d7 Refund per bottle\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total refund} = 140 \\times 0.10 = 14 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, you will get back **$14** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.",
