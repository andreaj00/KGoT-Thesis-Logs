Row 28: Incorrect (Expected: Fred, Got: To determine who did not give a gift in the Secret Santa exchange, we can analyze the gift assignments and the gifts given.

1. **List of Employees**:

   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Sara
   - Fred → Rebecca
   - Alex → Tyson

3. **Gifts Given**:
   - Galileo Galilei biography
   - Fishing reel
   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - “War and Peace” American film copy
   - Yarn
   - “One Piece” graphic novel
   - “War and Peace” novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

Since there are 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, one employee did not give a gift. 

Next, we can check the gift assignments to see if any employee is missing from the list of gift givers:

- **Gift Assignments**:
   - Harry (gives to Miguel)
   - Rebecca (gives to Micah)
   - Georgette (gives to Lucy)
   - Micah (gives to Jun)
   - Perry (gives to Georgette)
   - Tyson (gives to Fred)
   - Lucy (gives to Alex)
   - Jun (gives to Harry)
   - Sara (gives to Perry)
   - Miguel (gives to Sara)
   - Fred (gives to Rebecca)
   - Alex (gives to Tyson)

Now, let's count the unique givers:
- Harry
- Rebecca
- Georgette
- Micah
- Perry
- Tyson
- Lucy
- Jun
- Sara
- Miguel
- Fred
- Alex

All 12 employees are accounted for in the gift assignments, but since only 11 gifts were given, we need to identify who did not give a gift.

By analyzing the gifts given, we can see that:
- Each gift corresponds to a specific interest of the recipient, but we do not have a direct mapping of who received which gift.

However, we can deduce that since all employees are listed as givers, the only person who is not mentioned in the gift assignments is **Perry**. 

Thus, **Perry did not give a gift**.)

Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for an ISBN-10 number, you can use the following formula:

3. Sum all the products.
4. Take the sum modulo 11.

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To calculate the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to know the density of Freon-12 at the temperature and pressure conditions present there.

1. **Density of Freon-12**: The density of Freon-12 (Dichlorodifluoromethane) at room temperature (around 20°C) is approximately 1.49 g/cm³. However, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the temperature is around 1°C and the pressure is significantly higher (about 1100 times atmospheric pressure). The density of Freon-12 increases under these conditions.

2. **Density Adjustment**: For Freon-12 at 1°C and under high pressure, the density can be estimated to be around 1.55 g/cm³. 

3. **Convert mass to grams**: 
   \[
   0.312 \text{ kg} = 312 \text{ g}
   \]

4. **Calculate volume using density**:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{312 \text{ g}}{1.55 \text{ g/cm}^3} \approx 201.29 \text{ cm}^3
   \]

5. **Convert cm³ to mL**: Since 1 cm³ is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is approximately 201.29 mL.

6. **Round to the nearest mL**: 
   \[
   \text{Rounded Volume} = 201 \text{ mL}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

201)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To calculate how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles during your trip from California to Maine, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance of your trip**: 
   - From Los Angeles, CA to Cincinnati, OH via I-40.
   - From Cincinnati, OH to Augusta, ME via I-90.

   The approximate distances are:
   - Los Angeles to Cincinnati: about 1,800 miles.
   - Cincinnati to Augusta: about 1,000 miles.
   - Total distance = 1,800 miles + 1,000 miles = 2,800 miles.

2. **Calculate the number of water bottles consumed**:
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - For 2,800 miles, the calculation is:
     \[
     \text{Number of 100-mile segments} = \frac{2800}{100} = 28
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total water bottles} = 28 \times 5 = 140
     \]

3. **Determine the recycling refund per bottle**:
   - The refund for recycling water bottles varies by state, but a common amount is $0.05 per bottle in many states.

4. **Calculate the total refund**:
   - Total refund = Number of bottles × Refund per bottle
   \[
   \text{Total refund} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7.00
   \]

Therefore, you will get back **$7.00** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 115: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many clients will be receiving the sunset awning design, we need to identify the clients with even-numbered street addresses, as those houses face west and require sunset awnings.

Let's analyze the provided data:

1. **Michael Scott** - 8602 Begonia Drive (Even)
2. **Jim Halpert** - 6233 Plumeria Lane (Odd)
3. **Pam Beasley** - 6232 Plumeria Lane (Even)

- **Pam Beasley** - 6232 Plumeria Lane
- **Creed Bratton** - 2024 Orchid Avenue

- **Michael Scott** - Yes (Even address)
- **Pam Beasley** - Yes (Even address)
- **Creed Bratton** - No (Even address, but not specified)
- **William Schneider** - No (Even address, but not specified)

From the analysis, the clients receiving the sunset awning design are:

If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?

Row 145: Incorrect (Expected: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Got: The five classes in the group, based on the information provided, are:

1. Death Knight (plate wearer, likely the tank)
2. Druid (bear form, likely the tank)
3. Mage (cloth wearer, using ice spells)
4. Priest (cloth wearer, likely the healer casting holy spells)
5. Paladin (plate wearer, likely the healer casting holy spells)

Since the tank and healer are both casting holy spells, and one of the plate wearers is a Paladin, the other plate wearer must be a Death Knight. The bear attacking the boss indicates that the Druid is in bear form. 

The classes in alphabetical order are:

**Death Knight, Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest**)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of **Survivor**, there have been **44 unique winners** since the show premiered in 2000. 

On the other hand, **American Idol** has had **20 unique winners** since its debut in 2002. 

To find out how many more unique winners there have been in Survivor compared to American Idol, you can subtract the number of American Idol winners from the number of Survivor winners:

44 (Survivor winners) - 20 (American Idol winners) = 24

Therefore, there have been **24 more unique winners** in Survivor compared to American Idol.)
