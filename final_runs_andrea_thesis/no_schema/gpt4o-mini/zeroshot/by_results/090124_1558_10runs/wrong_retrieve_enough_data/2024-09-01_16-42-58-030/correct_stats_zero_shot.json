Multiply each digit by its corresponding weight.\n3. Sum all the products.\n4. Take the sum modulo 11.\n5. The check digit is the value that, when added to the sum, results in a multiple of 11. If the check digit is 10, it is represented as 'X'.\n\nSince you mentioned the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales, but did not provide the actual ID, I will demonstrate the calculation process using a hypothetical 9-digit number. You can replace the digits with the actual digits of the Tropicos ID.\n\nLet's say the first 9 digits of the Tropicos ID are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n1. Assign weights:\n   - 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\n\n2. Multiply each digit by its weight:\n   - (0 * 10) + (1 * 9) + (2 * 8) + (3 * 7) + (4 * 6) + (5 * 5) + (6 * 4) + (7 * 3) + (8 * 2)\n   - = 0 + 9 + 16 + 21 + 24 + 25 + 24 + 21 + 16\n   - = 136\n\n3. Take the sum modulo 11:\n   - 136 mod 11 = 4\n\n4. The check digit is:\n   - 11 - 4 = 7\n\nSo, if the first 9 digits of the Tropicos ID were 012345678, the check digit would be 7, making the complete ISBN-10 number 0123456787.\n\nPlease provide the actual Tropicos ID digits for a specific calculation.",
