   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex

3. **Gifts Given**:

   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - “War and Peace” American film copy
   - Yarn
   - “One Piece” graphic novel
   - “War and Peace” novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

Since there are 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, one employee did not give a gift. 

Next, we can check the gift assignments to see if any employee is missing from the list of gift givers:

- **Gift Assignments**:
   - Harry (gives to Miguel)
   - Rebecca (gives to Micah)
   - Georgette (gives to Lucy)
   - Micah (gives to Jun)
   - Perry (gives to Georgette)
   - Tyson (gives to Fred)
   - Lucy (gives to Alex)
   - Jun (gives to Harry)
   - Sara (gives to Perry)
   - Miguel (gives to Sara)
   - Fred (gives to Rebecca)
   - Alex (gives to Tyson)

Now, let's see who received gifts:
- Miguel (from Harry)
- Micah (from Rebecca)
- Lucy (from Georgette)
- Jun (from Micah)
- Georgette (from Perry)
- Fred (from Tyson)
- Alex (from Lucy)
- Harry (from Jun)
- Perry (from Sara)
- Sara (from Miguel)
- Rebecca (from Fred)
- Tyson (from Alex)

All employees except **Perry** received a gift. 

Thus, the employee who did not give a gift is **Perry**.)

Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for an ISBN-10 number, you can use the following formula:

1. Assign weights to each of the first 9 digits, starting from 10 down to 2.
2. Multiply each digit by its corresponding weight.
3. Sum all the products.
4. Take the sum modulo 11.
5. The check digit is the value that, when added to the sum, results in a multiple of 11. If the result is 10, the check digit is represented as 'X'.

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To calculate the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to know the density of Freon-12 at the peak temperature in that environment.

1. **Density of Freon-12**: The density of Freon-12 (Dichlorodifluoromethane) at room temperature is approximately 1.49 g/cm³. However, the density can change with temperature and pressure. At the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the pressure is extremely high, which can increase the density of the refrigerant.

2. **Temperature at the bottom of the Marianas Trench**: The temperature at the bottom of the trench is around 1-4°C. For the sake of this calculation, we can use the density of Freon-12 at 0°C, which is approximately 1.49 g/cm³.

3. **Convert mass to grams**: 
   \[
   0.312 \text{ kg} = 312 \text{ g}
   \]

4. **Calculate the volume using the density**:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{312 \text{ g}}{1.49 \text{ g/cm}^3} \approx 209.4 \text{ cm}^3
   \]

5. **Convert cm³ to mL**: Since 1 cm³ is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is:
   \[
   209.4 \text{ mL}
   \]

6. **Round to the nearest mL**: 
   \[
   \text{Rounded Volume} = 209 \text{ mL}
   \]

Thus, the volume of the system comprised of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest mL, is:

**209**)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To calculate how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we first need to determine the total distance of your trip and how many water bottles you will use.

1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance from Los Angeles, California to Cincinnati, Ohio via I-40 is approximately 2,000 miles.
   - The distance from Cincinnati, Ohio to Augusta, Maine via I-90 is approximately 1,000 miles.
   - Total distance = 2,000 miles + 1,000 miles = 3,000 miles.

2. **Water Bottles Calculation**:
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - For 3,000 miles, the number of 100-mile segments is 3,000 miles / 100 miles = 30 segments.
   - Total water bottles consumed = 30 segments * 5 bottles/segment = 150 bottles.

3. **Recycling Refund Calculation**:
   - According to the information typically found on recycling refund policies, the refund for a water bottle is often around $0.05 per bottle in states that have a bottle deposit law.
   - Assuming you are in a state with a $0.05 refund per bottle, the total refund would be:
     - Total refund = 150 bottles * $0.05/bottle = $7.50.

Therefore, you will get back **$7.50** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 115: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many clients will be receiving the sunset awning design, we need to identify the clients with even-numbered street addresses, as these houses face west and require sunset awnings.

Let's analyze the provided data:

1. **Michael Scott** - 8602 Begonia Drive (Even)
2. **Jim Halpert** - 6233 Plumeria Lane (Odd)
3. **Pam Beasley** - 6232 Plumeria Lane (Even)
4. **Dwight Schrute** - 451 Rafflesia Street (Odd)

10. **Kevin Malone** - 4015 Orchid Avenue (Odd)
11. **Meredith Palmer** - 4033 Orchid Avenue (Odd)
12. **Toby Flenderson** - 1239 Orchid Avenue (Odd)

Now, let's list the clients with even-numbered addresses:

- Michael Scott (8602 Begonia Drive)
- Pam Beasley (6232 Plumeria Lane)
- Creed Bratton (2024 Orchid Avenue)
- William Schneider (2024 Orchid Avenue)

Next, we check if these clients have ordered the sunset awning design:

- **Michael Scott** - No indication of awning type.
- **Pam Beasley** - No indication of awning type.
- **Creed Bratton** - No indication of awning type.
- **William Schneider** - No indication of awning type.

Since the awning type is not specified for any of the clients, we cannot definitively say how many clients will be receiving the sunset awning design based on the provided data. 

However, if we assume that all clients with even-numbered addresses are receiving sunset awnings, then the total number of clients receiving sunset awnings would be **4** (Michael Scott, Pam Beasley, Creed Bratton, and William Schneider). 

If you have specific information about which clients ordered sunset awnings, please provide that for a more accurate count.)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of **Survivor**, there have been **44 unique winners** since the show premiered in 2000. 

On the other hand, **American Idol** has had **20 seasons** (as of 2023) with a total of **20 unique winners** since its debut in 2002. 

To find out how many more unique winners there have been in Survivor compared to American Idol, we can subtract the number of American Idol winners from the number of Survivor winners:

44 (Survivor winners) - 20 (American Idol winners) = 24

Therefore, there have been **24 more unique winners** in Survivor compared to American Idol.)
