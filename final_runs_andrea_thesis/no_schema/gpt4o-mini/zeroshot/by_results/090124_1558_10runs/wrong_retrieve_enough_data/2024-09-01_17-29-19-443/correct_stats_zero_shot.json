However, the density can change with temperature and pressure. At the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the pressure is extremely high, which can increase the density of the refrigerant.\n\n2. **Temperature at the bottom of the Marianas Trench**: The temperature at the bottom of the trench is around 1-4\u00b0C. For the sake of this calculation, we can use the density of Freon-12 at 0\u00b0C, which is approximately 1.49 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n3. **Convert mass to grams**: \n   \\[\n   0.312 \\text{ kg} = 312 \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the volume using the density**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Density}} = \\frac{312 \\text{ g}}{1.49 \\text{ g/cm}^3} \\approx 209.4 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert cm\u00b3 to mL**: Since 1 cm\u00b3 is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is:\n   \\[\n   209.4 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round to the nearest mL**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Rounded Volume} = 209 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the system comprised of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest mL, is:\n\n**209**",
