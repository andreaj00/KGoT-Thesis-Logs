However, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the temperature is around 1\u00b0C and the pressure is significantly higher (about 1100 times atmospheric pressure). The density of Freon-12 increases under these conditions. For the sake of this calculation, we can use a density of approximately 1.55 g/cm\u00b3, which is a reasonable estimate for Freon-12 under high pressure.\n\n2. **Convert mass to grams**: \n   \\[\n   0.312 \\text{ kg} = 312 \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the volume using the density**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{density}} = \\frac{312 \\text{ g}}{1.55 \\text{ g/cm}^3} \\approx 201.29 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert cm\u00b3 to mL**: Since 1 cm\u00b3 is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is:\n   \\[\n   201.29 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the nearest mL**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rounded volume} = 201 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n201",

In California, for example, the refund is usually $0.10 per bottle.\n   - Assuming you are recycling in California and that the same refund applies throughout your trip, the total refund would be:\n     - Total refund = 150 bottles * $0.10/bottle = $15.00.\n\nThus, you will get back **$15.00** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.",
