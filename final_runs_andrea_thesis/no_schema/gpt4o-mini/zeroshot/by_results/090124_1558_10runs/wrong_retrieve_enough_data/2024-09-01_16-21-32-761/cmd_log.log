Row 28: Incorrect (Expected: Fred, Got: To determine who did not give a gift in the Secret Santa exchange, we can analyze the gift assignments and the gifts given.

1. **Gift Assignments**:
   - Harry → Miguel
   - Rebecca → Micah
   - Georgette → Lucy
   - Micah → Jun
   - Perry → Georgette
   - Tyson → Fred
   - Lucy → Alex
   - Jun → Harry
   - Sara → Perry
   - Miguel → Rebecca
   - Fred → Sara
   - Alex → Tyson

2. **Gifts Given**:
   - Galileo Galilei biography
   - Fishing reel
   - Raku programming guide
   - Chisel set
   - Custom dice
   - “War and Peace” American film copy
   - Yarn
   - “One Piece” graphic novel
   - “War and Peace” novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

3. **Analysis**:
   - There are 12 employees, but only 11 gifts were given. This means one employee did not give a gift.
   - Each gift corresponds to a specific interest of the recipient based on their profiles.

4. **Identifying the Missing Gift Giver**:
   - Let's match the gifts to the recipients based on their interests:
     - **Miguel** (Astronomy, Decorative Washi Tape, Ketchup) → No gift matches.
     - **Micah** (Knitting, Rainy Weather, Books) → “War and Peace” novel (matches Books).
     - **Lucy** (Coffee, Physics, Board Games) → Starbucks gift card (matches Coffee).
     - **Jun** (Woodworking, Barbecue, JavaScript) → Chisel set (matches Woodworking).
     - **Georgette** (Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy) → Foam exercise mat (no match).
     - **Perry** (Old Movies, Rats, Journaling) → “War and Peace” American film copy (no match).
     - **Tyson** (Historical Fiction Novels, Biking, Parakeets) → Raku programming guide (no match).
     - **Sara** (Tabletop RPGs, Spas, Music) → Custom dice (no match).
     - **Fred** (Chemistry, Perl, Cats) → No gift matches.
     - **Alex** (Surfing, Audrey Hepburn, Manga) → “One Piece” graphic novel (no match).
     - **Harry** (Fishing, Camping, Wine) → Fishing reel (matches Fishing).
     - **Rebecca** (Cars, Dogs, Chocolate) → No gift matches.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only employee who does not have a corresponding gift that matches their interests is **Georgette**, as her assigned gift (Foam exercise mat) does not match any of her interests (Yoga, Cooking, Green Energy).
   - Therefore, **Georgette did not give a gift**.)

Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for an ISBN-10 number, you can use the following formula:

1. Assign weights to each of the first 9 digits, starting from 10 down to 2.
2. Multiply each digit by its corresponding weight.
3. Sum all the products.
4. Take the sum modulo 11.
5. The check digit is the value that, when added to the sum, results in a multiple of 11. If the result is 10, the check digit is represented as 'X'.

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To calculate the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to know the density of Freon-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) at the temperature and pressure conditions present there.

1. **Density of Freon-12**: The density of Freon-12 at room temperature (around 20°C) is approximately 1.49 g/cm³. However, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the temperature is around 1°C and the pressure is significantly higher (about 1100 times atmospheric pressure). The density of Freon-12 increases under these conditions. For the sake of this calculation, we can use a density of approximately 1.55 g/cm³, which is a reasonable estimate for Freon-12 under high pressure.

2. **Convert mass to grams**: 
   \[
   0.312 \text{ kg} = 312 \text{ g}
   \]

3. **Calculate the volume using the density**:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}} = \frac{312 \text{ g}}{1.55 \text{ g/cm}^3} \approx 201.29 \text{ cm}^3
   \]

4. **Convert cm³ to mL**: Since 1 cm³ is equivalent to 1 mL, the volume in mL is:
   \[
   201.29 \text{ mL}
   \]

5. **Round to the nearest mL**:
   \[
   \text{Rounded volume} = 201 \text{ mL}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

201)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To calculate how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we first need to determine the total distance of your trip and how many water bottles you will use.

1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance from Los Angeles, California to Cincinnati, Ohio via I-40 is approximately 2,000 miles.
   - The distance from Cincinnati, Ohio to Augusta, Maine via I-90 is approximately 1,000 miles.
   - Total distance = 2,000 miles + 1,000 miles = 3,000 miles.

2. **Water Bottles Calculation**:
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - For 3,000 miles, the number of 100-mile segments is 3,000 miles / 100 miles = 30 segments.
   - Therefore, the total number of water bottles consumed = 30 segments * 5 bottles/segment = 150 bottles.

3. **Recycling Refund Calculation**:
   - According to the information typically found on recycling refund policies, the refund for recycling a water bottle can vary by state. In California, for example, the refund is usually $0.10 per bottle.
   - Assuming you are recycling in California and that the same refund applies throughout your trip, the total refund would be:
     - Total refund = 150 bottles * $0.10/bottle = $15.00.

Thus, you will get back **$15.00** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 115: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many clients will be receiving the sunset awning design, we need to identify the clients with even-numbered street addresses, as those houses face west and require sunset awnings.

Let's analyze the provided data:

1. **Michael Scott** - 8602 Begonia Drive (Even)
2. **Jim Halpert** - 6233 Plumeria Lane (Odd)
3. **Pam Beasley** - 6232 Plumeria Lane (Even)

- **Pam Beasley** - 6232 Plumeria Lane
- **Creed Bratton** - 2024 Orchid Avenue

- **Michael Scott** - Yes (Even address)
- **Pam Beasley** - No (Even address)
- **Creed Bratton** - No (Even address)
- **William Schneider** - No (Even address)

Only **Michael Scott** is receiving a sunset awning design.

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of **Survivor**, there have been **44 unique winners** since the show premiered in 2000. 

On the other hand, **American Idol** has had **20 seasons** (as of 2023) with a total of **20 unique winners** since its debut in 2002. 

To find out how many more unique winners there have been in Survivor compared to American Idol, we can subtract the number of American Idol winners from the number of Survivor winners:

44 (Survivor winners) - 20 (American Idol winners) = 24

Therefore, there have been **24 more unique winners** in Survivor compared to American Idol.)
