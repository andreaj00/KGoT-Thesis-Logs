However, the conditions at the bottom of the Marianas Trench (about 11,000 meters deep) will significantly affect the density due to the high pressure. \n\n2. **Pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench**: The pressure at the bottom of the trench is approximately 1100 times atmospheric pressure, or about 110 MPa (megapascals).\n\n3. **Effect of pressure on density**: The density of Freon-12 will increase under high pressure. For many substances, the density can increase by about 5-10% under such high pressures. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume a density increase of about 10%, making the effective density approximately 1.49 g/cm\u00b3 * 1.10 = 1.639 g/cm\u00b3.\n\n4. **Convert density to kg/m\u00b3**: \n   \\[\n   1.639 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 = 1639 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the volume**: The volume \\( V \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{m}{\\rho}\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass in kg and \\( \\rho \\) is the density in kg/m\u00b3.\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{0.312 \\, \\text{kg}}{1639 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3} \\approx 0.0001905 \\, \\text{m}^3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convert volume to milliliters**: \n   \\[\n   1 \\, \\text{m}^3 = 1,000,000 \\, \\text{mL}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   V \\approx 0.0001905 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\times 1,000,000 \\, \\text{mL/m}^3 \\approx 190.5 \\, \\text{mL}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Round to the nearest mL**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Rounded volume} = 191 \\, \\text{mL}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest mL, is **191**.",
