   - “War and Peace” novel
   - Starbucks gift card
   - Foam exercise mat

Since there are 12 employees but only 11 gifts were given, one employee did not give a gift. 

Next, we can check the gift assignments to see if any employee is missing from the list of gift givers:

- **Gift Assignments**:
   - Harry (gives to Miguel)
   - Rebecca (gives to Micah)
   - Georgette (gives to Lucy)
   - Micah (gives to Jun)
   - Perry (gives to Georgette)
   - Tyson (gives to Fred)

   - Jun (gives to Harry)
   - Sara (gives to Perry)
   - Miguel (gives to Sara)
   - Fred (gives to Rebecca)
   - Alex (gives to Tyson)

Now, let's see who received gifts:
- Miguel (from Harry)
- Micah (from Rebecca)
- Lucy (from Georgette)
- Jun (from Micah)
- Georgette (from Perry)
- Fred (from Tyson)
- Alex (from Lucy)
- Harry (from Jun)
- Perry (from Sara)
- Sara (from Miguel)
- Rebecca (from Fred)
- Tyson (from Alex)

All employees except **Perry** received a gift. 

Thus, the employee who did not give a gift is **Perry**.)

Docs: []
Query with Attached Docs: Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 45: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To compute the check digit for an ISBN-10 number, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ISBN-10 structure**: An ISBN-10 consists of 9 digits followed by a check digit, which can be a digit from 0 to 9 or the letter 'X' (which represents the value 10).

2. **Calculate the check digit**: The check digit is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C = (d_1 \times 1 + d_2 \times 2 + d_3 \times 3 + d_4 \times 4 + d_5 \times 5 + d_6 \times 6 + d_7 \times 7 + d_8 \times 8 + d_9 \times 9) \mod 11
   \]
   where \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_9\) are the first 9 digits of the ISBN.

3. **Determine the check digit**: The check digit \(C\) is then:
   - If \(C = 10\), the check digit is 'X'.
   - If \(C < 10\), the check digit is simply \(C\).

Since you mentioned the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales, I would need the first 9 digits of that ID to compute the check digit. If you provide those digits, I can help you calculate the check digit.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 68: Incorrect (Expected: 55, Got: To calculate the volume of 0.312 kg of Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, we need to know the density of Freon-12 (also known as dichlorodifluoromethane) at the temperature and pressure conditions present in the trench.

1. **Density of Freon-12**: The density of Freon-12 at room temperature (around 20°C) is approximately 1.49 g/cm³. However, the conditions at the bottom of the Marianas Trench (about 11,000 meters deep) will significantly affect the density due to the high pressure. 

2. **Pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench**: The pressure at the bottom of the trench is approximately 1100 times atmospheric pressure, or about 110 MPa (megapascals).

3. **Effect of pressure on density**: The density of Freon-12 will increase under high pressure. For many substances, the density can increase by about 5-10% under such high pressures. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume a density increase of about 10%, making the effective density approximately 1.49 g/cm³ * 1.10 = 1.639 g/cm³.

4. **Convert density to kg/m³**: 
   \[
   1.639 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 1639 \, \text{kg/m}^3
   \]

5. **Calculate the volume**: The volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{m}{\rho}
   \]
   where \( m \) is the mass in kg and \( \rho \) is the density in kg/m³.

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V = \frac{0.312 \, \text{kg}}{1639 \, \text{kg/m}^3} \approx 0.0001905 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

6. **Convert volume to milliliters**: 
   \[
   1 \, \text{m}^3 = 1,000,000 \, \text{mL}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   V \approx 0.0001905 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1,000,000 \, \text{mL/m}^3 \approx 190.5 \, \text{mL}
   \]

7. **Round to the nearest mL**: 
   \[
   \text{Rounded volume} = 191 \, \text{mL}
   \]

Thus, the volume of the Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, rounded to the nearest mL, is **191**.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 111: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To calculate how many dollars you will get back from recycling your water bottles, we first need to determine the total distance of your trip and how many water bottles you will use.

1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance from Los Angeles, California to Cincinnati, Ohio via I-40 is approximately 2,000 miles.
   - The distance from Cincinnati, Ohio to Augusta, Maine via I-90 is approximately 1,000 miles.
   - Total distance = 2,000 miles + 1,000 miles = 3,000 miles.

2. **Water Bottles Calculation**:
   - You drink 5 water bottles for every 100 miles.
   - For 3,000 miles, the calculation is:
     \[
     \text{Number of 100-mile segments} = \frac{3000}{100} = 30
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total water bottles} = 30 \times 5 = 150
     \]

3. **Recycling Value**:
   - According to Wikipedia, the average refund for recycling a water bottle in California is $0.10 per bottle.
   - Therefore, the total refund for 150 bottles is:
     \[
     \text{Total refund} = 150 \times 0.10 = 15.00
     \]

So, you will get back **$15.00** from recycling your water bottles at the end of your trip.)

Row 151: Incorrect (Expected: 21, Got: As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of **Survivor**, there have been **44 unique winners** since the show premiered in 2000. 

On the other hand, **American Idol** has had **20 unique winners** since its debut in 2002. 

To find out how many more unique winners there have been in Survivor compared to American Idol, you can subtract the number of American Idol winners from the number of Survivor winners:

44 (Survivor winners) - 20 (American Idol winners) = 24

Therefore, there have been **24 more unique winners** in Survivor compared to American Idol.)
