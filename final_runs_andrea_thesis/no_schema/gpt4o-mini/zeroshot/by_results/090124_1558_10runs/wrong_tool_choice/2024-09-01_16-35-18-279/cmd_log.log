Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected by the pistons. Let's analyze the situation based on the rules provided:

1. **Initial Setup**: The first three balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Piston Actions**:
   - If the **first piston** fires, it ejects the ball in the first position (ball 1). The balls in positions 2 and 3 (balls 2 and 3) advance, and the next ball on the ramp (ball 4) takes the third position.
   - If the **second piston** fires, it ejects the ball in the second position (ball 2). The ball in the first position (ball 1) rolls away, the ball in the third position (ball 3) advances to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp (balls 4 and 5) take the second and third positions.
   - If the **third piston** fires, it ejects the ball in the third position (ball 3). The ball in the first position (ball 1) rolls away, the ball in the second position (ball 2) advances to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp (balls 4 and 5) take the second and third positions.

3. **Probabilities**:
   - Each piston has an equal chance of firing (1/3 probability for each).
   - If you choose ball 1, it can only be ejected if the first piston fires.
   - If you choose ball 2, it can only be ejected if the second piston fires.
   - If you choose ball 3, it can only be ejected if the third piston fires.

Since all three balls have an equal probability of being ejected (1/3), the choice of which ball to pick does not affect the odds of winning. However, since the game starts with balls 1, 2, and 3, and you want to maximize your chances based on the immediate setup, you should choose **ball 2**. 

This is because if the second piston fires, you win immediately, and if the first or third pistons fire, the game continues with the next balls. 

Thus, the best choice to maximize your odds of winning the grand prize is to select **ball 2**.)

Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using a modified checksum calculation. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: 
   - The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the digits, but in this case, we will use weights of 1 and an unknown weight \( w \) for the digits in the transposed columns.

2. **Identify the Structure**: 
   - The first three columns are fixed, and the last column is the checksum. The columns that are transposed are between the 4th and 10th columns.

3. **Calculate the Checksum**:
   - For each number, we will calculate the checksum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Checksum} = (d_0 \cdot 1 + d_1 \cdot w + d_2 \cdot 1 + d_3 \cdot w + d_4 \cdot 1 + d_5 \cdot w + d_6 \cdot 1 + d_7 \cdot w + d_8 \cdot 1 + d_9 \cdot w) \mod 10
     \]
   - The checksum digit \( d_{10} \) should satisfy:
     \[
     \text{Checksum} \equiv d_{10} \mod 10
     \]

4. **Iterate Over Possible Weights**:
   - We will iterate over possible weights \( w \) from 1 to 9 and check each ISBN number to see if it validates correctly.

5. **Check Each ISBN**:
   - For each ISBN, we will check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the above logic in a structured way.

```python
def validate_isbn(isbn, weight):
    # Remove hyphens
    isbn = isbn.replace('-', '')
    # Extract digits
    digits = [int(d) for d in isbn[:-1]]  # All but the last digit
    checksum_digit = int(isbn[-1])  # Last digit is the checksum
    
    # Calculate checksum
    checksum = 0
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index
            checksum += digits[i] * 1
        else:  # Odd index
            checksum += digits[i] * weight
            
    # Final checksum mod 10
    calculated_checksum = checksum % 10
    
    return calculated_checksum == checksum_digit

# List of ISBNs
isbns = [
    "978-354181391-9",
    "978-946669746-1",
    "978-398036139-6",
    "978-447656680-4",
    "978-279586664-7",
    "978-595073693-3",
    "978-976647652-6",
    "978-591178125-5",
    "978-728465924-5",
    "978-414825155-9"
]

# Check for each weight from 1 to 9
results = []
for weight in range(1, 10):
    valid = True
    for isbn in isbns:
        if not validate_isbn(isbn, weight):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        results.append((weight, 4))  # Assuming the smaller index of the two transposed columns is 4

# Output results
results
```

### Conclusion:

After running the above logic, we would find the valid weights and the corresponding smaller index of the transposed columns. The output will be in the form \( x, y \) where \( x \) is the weight and \( y \) is the smaller index of the two transposed columns. 

Please run the code in a suitable Python environment to get the exact results.)

</attached_docs>
Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," it must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the statement made by the vampire.

2. **Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement made by the humans is true.
   - If there are no humans, then the statement made by the vampires would be false, which creates a contradiction since they would be admitting to the existence of humans.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since all residents said "At least one of us is a human," and this statement cannot be false (as it would lead to a contradiction), it implies that there must be at least one human in the village.
   - If there is at least one human, then the vampires must be lying about the number of vampires, but they cannot deny the existence of humans.

Given that the statement "At least one of us is a human" is true, it indicates that there is at least one human in the village. However, since all residents gave the same response, it suggests that the number of vampires must be such that they cannot all be vampires, or else they would contradict themselves.

Thus, the only logical conclusion is that there is exactly **one vampire** in the village of Șirnea, and the rest are humans. Therefore, the answer is:

**1 resident of Șirnea has been turned into a vampire.**)

Your answer should be a numerical integer value.
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF after going in the wrong direction, we need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the closest metro station is Smithsonian on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Cleveland Park** station on the Red Line.
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow/Blue lines.

Now, let's find the route:

- From **Smithsonian** to **Cleveland Park**: You would take the Orange or Blue line towards the direction of New Carrollton or Largo Town Center, and then transfer to the Red Line at Gallery Place-Chinatown to go to Cleveland Park.
- From **Cleveland Park** to **National Airport**: You would need to go back to Gallery Place-Chinatown, transfer to the Yellow or Blue line, and then head towards National Airport.

However, since you mentioned not changing lines, we will focus on the distance in terms of stations without changing lines.

1. **Cleveland Park** is on the Red Line.
2. **National Airport** is on the Yellow/Blue lines.

Since you cannot travel directly from Cleveland Park to National Airport without changing lines, we need to calculate the distance in terms of stations on the Red Line and then find the distance to the nearest transfer point.

- The nearest transfer point from the Red Line to the Yellow/Blue lines is **Gallery Place-Chinatown**.
- From **Cleveland Park** to **Gallery Place-Chinatown** is 4 stations (Cleveland Park → Van Ness-UDC → Tenleytown-AU → Friendship Heights → Gallery Place-Chinatown).
- From **Gallery Place-Chinatown** to **National Airport** is 2 stations (Gallery Place-Chinatown → L'Enfant Plaza → National Airport).

However, since you are asking how many stations away you are from your original destination without changing lines, we can only count the stations on the Red Line.

Thus, you are effectively 4 stations away from the transfer point (Gallery Place-Chinatown) and then need to consider the additional stations to reach your destination.

In conclusion, if you are at Cleveland Park and want to reach National Airport without changing lines, you are effectively 4 stations away from the transfer point, and then you would need to change lines to reach your destination.

Therefore, the answer is:

**4**)

The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To solve the problem, we need to determine how the coins can be distributed among the three boxes while adhering to the given constraints:

1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.
3. The total number of coins is 30.

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( x \leq y \leq z \). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \( x \geq 2 \).
- Let’s say \( z = y + 6 \) (the box with the most coins has 6 more than the box with the second most).
- The total number of coins gives us the equation: 
  \[
  x + y + z = 30
  \]
  Substituting \( z \) into the equation, we get:
  \[
  x + y + (y + 6) = 30
  \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[
  x + 2y + 6 = 30
  \]
  \[
  x + 2y = 24
  \]
  \[
  x = 24 - 2y
  \]

Now, since \( x \) must be at least 2, we can set up the inequality:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Since \( y \) must also be at least \( x \) (which is \( 24 - 2y \)), we have:
\[
y \geq 24 - 2y
\]
\[
3y \geq 24
\]
\[
y \geq 8
\]

Thus, \( y \) can take values from 8 to 11. We can now calculate the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( z \):

1. If \( y = 8 \):
   - \( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8 \)
   - \( z = y + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \)
   - Distribution: \( (8, 8, 14) \)

2. If \( y = 9 \):
   - \( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6 \)
   - \( z = y + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Distribution: \( (6, 9, 15) \)

3. If \( y = 10 \):
   - \( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4 \)
   - \( z = y + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \)
   - Distribution: \( (4, 10, 16) \)

4. If \( y = 11 \):
   - \( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2 \)
   - \( z = y + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17 \)
   - Distribution: \( (2, 11, 17) \)

Now, we have the possible distributions of coins:
- \( (8, 8, 14) \)
- \( (6, 9, 15) \)
- \( (4, 10, 16) \)
- \( (2, 11, 17) \)

Next, we need to determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy. Bob should guess in a way that maximizes his winnings based on the distributions.

For each distribution, Bob can guess the following:
1. For \( (8, 8, 14) \): Guess \( (8, 8, 14) \) → Wins \( 8 + 8 + 14 = 30 \)
2. For \( (6, 9, 15) \): Guess \( (6, 9, 15) \) → Wins \( 6 + 9 + 15 = 30 \)
3. For \( (4, 10, 16) \): Guess \( (4, 10, 16) \) → Wins \( 4 + 10 + 16 = 30 \)
4. For \( (2, 11, 17) \): Guess \( (2, 11, 17) \) → Wins \( 2 + 11 + 17 = 30 \)

In all cases, Bob can win a maximum of 30 coins, which translates to $30,000.

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$30,000**.)

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 1.
   - 𒐚 represents the number 5.

So, 𒐐𒐚 represents the number 15.

Now, we can combine these values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) represents 10.
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) represents 15.

In the Babylonian system, the value is calculated as follows:
- The first symbol (10) is in the "60^1" place (which is 60), and the second symbol (15) is in the "60^0" place (which is 1).

Thus, the total value is:
\[ 10 \times 60 + 15 \times 1 = 600 + 15 = 615. \]

Therefore, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in Arabic numerals is **615**.)

Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To determine the colors on the removed cube, we need to analyze the information provided about the Rubik's cube.

1. **Cubes with Faces**:
   - 6 face cubes (1 colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (2 colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (3 colored faces each)

2. **Cubes Found**:
   - All blue cubes have been found.
   - All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, below) have been found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corner cubes have been found, along with all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces.

### Analyzing the Information:

- Since all blue cubes are found, blue is not a color on the removed cube.
- The orange center cube is surrounded by cubes that are adjacent to it, meaning all adjacent orange cubes are found.
- The green corners and green cubes bordering yellow are also found, indicating that green is not a color on the removed cube.
- The opposite face of the orange cubes has also been found, which means that the cubes on the opposite face of the orange center (which is red) are also accounted for.

### Possible Colors:
The standard Rubik's cube has the following colors: Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Red, and White.

From the information:
- Blue: Found
- Orange: Found (and its opposite face, which is Red, is also found)
- Green: Found (and its adjacent yellow cubes are also found)
- Yellow: Found (since green cubes bordering yellow are found)
- Red: Found (as it is the opposite of orange)

The only color left that has not been accounted for is **White**.

### Conclusion:
Since the removed cube has two colors and all other colors have been accounted for, the only possible colors for the removed cube are **White** and **Yellow**.

Thus, the colors on the removed cube are:

**White, Yellow**.)
