Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose ball number **2**.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the mechanics**:
   - If the piston for the **first position** fires, ball 1 is ejected, and balls 2 and 3 advance. A new ball from the ramp (ball 4) comes in to occupy the third position.
   - If the piston for the **second position** fires, ball 2 is ejected, and ball 3 moves to the first position. Two new balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) come in to occupy the second and third positions.
   - If the piston for the **third position** fires, ball 3 is ejected, ball 2 moves to the first position, and two new balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) come in to occupy the second and third positions.

2. **Analyzing the probabilities**:
   - If you choose ball 1, it can only be ejected if the first piston fires.
   - If you choose ball 2, it can be ejected if the second piston fires.
   - If you choose ball 3, it can be ejected if the first or third pistons fire.

3. **Calculating the chances**:
   - The first piston has a 1/3 chance of firing, which would eject ball 1.
   - The second piston also has a 1/3 chance of firing, which would eject ball 2.
   - The third piston has a 1/3 chance of firing, which would eject ball 3.

However, if you choose ball 2, it has a direct chance of being ejected (1/3) and also indirectly affects the outcome of the other balls. If ball 1 is ejected, ball 2 remains, and if ball 3 is ejected, ball 2 moves to the first position, still keeping it in play.

Thus, choosing ball 2 gives you the best chance of being ejected directly and keeps it in play longer than the other options. Therefore, the optimal choice is to select **ball number 2**.)

Solving question 50:
Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using a modified checksum calculation. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the digits. However, in this case, we will use weights of 1 and an unknown weight \( w \) (where \( 1 < w < 10 \)).

2. **Identify the Structure**: The ISBN-13 format is typically structured as follows:
   - The first three digits are the prefix (usually 978 or 979).
   - The next nine digits are the main identifier.
   - The last digit is the checksum.

3. **Calculate the Checksum**: For each number, we will calculate the checksum using the modified weights:
   - For a number represented as \( d_0 d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7 d_8 d_9 d_{10} \):
   - The checksum calculation will be:
     \[
     S = d_0 \cdot 1 + d_1 \cdot w + d_2 \cdot 1 + d_3 \cdot w + d_4 \cdot 1 + d_5 \cdot w + d_6 \cdot 1 + d_7 \cdot w + d_8 \cdot 1 + d_9 \cdot w
     \]
   - The checksum digit \( d_{10} \) should satisfy:
     \[
     S \mod 10 = d_{10}
     \]

4. **Iterate Over Possible Weights**: We will iterate over possible weights from 2 to 9 and check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit for each ISBN.

5. **Identify Transposed Columns**: Since two adjacent columns are transposed, we will need to check combinations of columns to see if swapping them results in a valid checksum.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the above logic in a structured way:

```python
def calculate_checksum(isbn, weight):
    # Remove hyphens
    isbn = isbn.replace("-", "")
    digits = [int(d) for d in isbn[:-1]]  # All but the last digit
    checksum_digit = int(isbn[-1])  # The last digit is the checksum
    
    # Calculate the checksum using the given weight
    S = 0
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index
            S += digits[i] * 1
        else:  # Odd index
            S += digits[i] * weight
            
    return S % 10 == checksum_digit

# List of ISBNs
isbns = [
    "978-354181391-9",
    "978-946669746-1",
    "978-398036139-6",
    "978-447656680-4",
    "978-279586664-7",
    "978-595073693-3",
    "978-976647652-6",
    "978-591178125-5",
    "978-728465924-5",
    "978-414825155-9"
]

# Check for each weight from 2 to 9
results = []
for weight in range(2, 10):
    valid = True
    for isbn in isbns:
        if not calculate_checksum(isbn, weight):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        results.append((weight, 3))  # Assuming the smaller index of the transposed columns is 3

# Output the results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion:

After running the above logic, we would find the valid weights and the index of the transposed columns. The output will be in the form \( x, y \) where \( x \) is the weight and \( y \) is the smaller index of the two transposed columns. 

Please run the code in a suitable Python environment to get the exact results.)

Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," it must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the statement made by the vampire.

2. **Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement made by the humans is true.
   - If there are no humans, then the statement made by the vampires would be true, which is a contradiction since vampires always lie.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since all residents said "At least one of us is a human," and this statement cannot be false, it implies that there must be at least one human in the village.
   - If there is at least one human, then the only way for all residents to say the same thing is if there are no vampires at all. If there were any vampires, they would have to lie, leading to a contradiction.

Thus, the only logical conclusion is that **there are no residents of Șirnea who have been turned into vampires**. All 100 residents are humans.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF after going in the wrong direction, we need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the closest metro station is Smithsonian on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Cleveland Park** station on the Red Line.
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow/Blue lines.

Now, let's find the route:

- From **Smithsonian** to **Cleveland Park**: You would travel on the Orange or Blue line towards the direction of New Carrollton or Largo Town Center, and then transfer to the Red Line at Gallery Place-Chinatown to go towards Glenmont.
- From **Cleveland Park** to **National Airport**: You would need to go back to Gallery Place-Chinatown, transfer to the Yellow or Blue line, and then head towards National Airport.

Now, let's count the stations:

1. **From Smithsonian to Cleveland Park**:
   - Smithsonian → L'Enfant Plaza → Federal Center SW → Capitol South → Eastern Market → Potomac Ave → Stadium-Armory → Minnesota Ave → Benning Road → Capitol Heights → Addison Road → Largo Town Center → New Carrollton (if you go the wrong way).
   - This is approximately 10 stations away.

2. **From Cleveland Park to National Airport**:
   - Cleveland Park → Woodley Park-Zoo → Dupont Circle → Farragut North → Gallery Place-Chinatown (transfer) → L'Enfant Plaza → National Airport.
   - This is approximately 6 stations away.

Now, if you add the two segments together, you would be approximately 16 stations away from your original destination if you don't change lines.

However, since you are looking for the number of stations away from your original destination after going in the wrong direction, you would only consider the distance from Cleveland Park to National Airport.

Thus, the answer is **6** stations away from your original destination.)



Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Query with Attached Docs: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To solve the problem, we need to determine how the coins can be distributed among the three boxes while adhering to the given constraints:

1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.
3. The total number of coins is 30.

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( x \leq y \leq z \). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \( x \geq 2 \).
- Let’s say \( z = y + 6 \) (the box with the most coins has 6 more than the box with the second most).
- The total number of coins gives us the equation: 
  \[
  x + y + z = 30
  \]
  Substituting \( z \) into the equation, we get:
  \[
  x + y + (y + 6) = 30
  \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[
  x + 2y + 6 = 30
  \]
  \[
  x + 2y = 24
  \]
  \[
  x = 24 - 2y
  \]

Now, since \( x \) must be at least 2, we can set up the inequality:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Since \( y \) must also be at least \( x \) (which is \( 24 - 2y \)), we have:
\[
y \geq 24 - 2y
\]
\[
3y \geq 24
\]
\[
y \geq 8
\]

Thus, \( y \) can take values from 8 to 11. We can now find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( z \):

1. If \( y = 8 \):
   \[
   x = 24 - 2(8) = 8, \quad z = 8 + 6 = 14 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x, y, z) = (8, 8, 14)
   \]

2. If \( y = 9 \):
   \[
   x = 24 - 2(9) = 6, \quad z = 9 + 6 = 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x, y, z) = (6, 9, 15)
   \]

3. If \( y = 10 \):
   \[
   x = 24 - 2(10) = 4, \quad z = 10 + 6 = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x, y, z) = (4, 10, 16)
   \]

4. If \( y = 11 \):
   \[
   x = 24 - 2(11) = 2, \quad z = 11 + 6 = 17 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x, y, z) = (2, 11, 17)
   \]

Now we have the possible distributions of coins:
- (8, 8, 14)
- (6, 9, 15)
- (4, 10, 16)
- (2, 11, 17)

Next, we need to determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy. Bob should guess in a way that maximizes his winnings based on the distributions.

1. For (8, 8, 14):
   - Guessing (8, 8, 14) would yield 8 + 8 + 14 = 30 coins.
   
2. For (6, 9, 15):
   - Guessing (6, 9, 15) would yield 6 + 9 + 15 = 30 coins.
   
3. For (4, 10, 16):
   - Guessing (4, 10, 16) would yield 4 + 10 + 16 = 30 coins.
   
4. For (2, 11, 17):
   - Guessing (2, 11, 17) would yield 2 + 11 + 17 = 30 coins.

In all cases, Bob can guess optimally to win the maximum amount of coins, which is 30 coins.

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is:
\[
\text{Minimum amount of money} = 30 \times 1000 = 30000
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{30000}
\])

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 1.
   - 𒐚 represents the number 5.

So, 𒐐𒐚 represents the number 15.

Now, we can combine these values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) represents 10.
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) represents 15.

In the Babylonian system, the value is calculated as follows:
- The first symbol (10) is in the "60^1" place (which is 60), and the second symbol (15) is in the "60^0" place (which is 1).

Thus, the total value is:
\[ 10 \times 60 + 15 \times 1 = 600 + 15 = 615. \]

Therefore, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in Arabic numerals is **615**.)

Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To determine the colors on the removed cube, we need to analyze the information provided about the Rubik's cube.

1. **Cubes with Faces**:
   - There are 6 face cubes (one colored face each).
   - There are 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each).
   - There are 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each).

2. **Cubes Found**:
   - All blue cubes have been found.
   - All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, below) have been found, along with the center cube itself.
   - All green corner cubes have been found, as well as all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Color Relationships**:
   - The orange center cube is surrounded by cubes that are either orange or adjacent to orange.
   - Since all orange cubes found imply that their opposite face cubes are also found, we can deduce that the opposite color of orange is red (in a standard Rubik's cube).
   - The green corners and green cubes bordering yellow suggest that yellow is also present and has been accounted for.

4. **Identifying the Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces.
   - Since all blue, green, and orange cubes have been accounted for, and the opposite face of orange (red) has also been found, the remaining colors that could be on the removed cube are yellow and red.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The removed cube must have two colors, which are yellow and red, as these are the only colors left that fit the criteria of having two colored faces.

Thus, the colors on the removed cube are:

**red, yellow**)
