Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you should choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected by the pistons. 

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Initial Setup**: The first three balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Piston Actions**:
   - If the **first piston** fires, it ejects the ball in the first position (ball 1). The balls in positions 2 and 3 (balls 2 and 3) advance, and the next ball from the ramp (ball 4) takes the third position.
   - If the **second piston** fires, it ejects the ball in the second position (ball 2). The ball in the first position (ball 1) rolls away, the ball in the third position (ball 3) advances to the first position, and the next two balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) take the second and third positions.
   - If the **third piston** fires, it ejects the ball in the third position (ball 3). The ball in the first position (ball 1) rolls away, the ball in the second position (ball 2) advances to the first position, and the next two balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) take the second and third positions.

3. **Ejection Probabilities**:
   - Each piston fires randomly, so each has a 1/3 chance of firing.
   - The balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3, so the probabilities of each ball being ejected are:
     - Ball 1: 1/3 chance (if the first piston fires)
     - Ball 2: 1/3 chance (if the second piston fires)
     - Ball 3: 1/3 chance (if the third piston fires)

Since all three balls have an equal probability of being ejected (1/3), your choice does not affect the odds of winning based on the initial setup of balls 1, 2, and 3.

However, if you want to maximize your chances of winning in subsequent rounds, you should consider that the game continues with new balls coming from the ramp. The balls that will come next (4, 5, etc.) will eventually replace the balls on the platform.

Given that the game starts with balls 1, 2, and 3, and you have to choose one of these, you can choose any of them. However, since the game is designed to continue with new balls, it might be strategic to choose ball 1, as it is the first ball and will be ejected first if the first piston fires.

Therefore, the best choice to maximize your odds of winning the grand prize is to select **ball 1**.)

Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using the modified ISBN-like checksum method. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. 

The general formula for calculating the checksum digit in this case is:

1. For the first digit, multiply by 1.
2. For the second digit, multiply by the unknown weight (let's call it W).
3. For the third digit, multiply by 1.
4. For the fourth digit, multiply by W.
5. Continue this pattern until the second-to-last digit.
6. The checksum digit is the value that makes the total sum a multiple of 10.

Given that two adjacent columns have been transposed, we will need to check each possible weight (from 1 to 9) and see if we can find a valid checksum for each of the provided numbers.

Let's denote the columns as follows:
- Column 0: 978
- Column 1: 354181391
- Column 2: 9 (checksum digit)

We will check the validity of the numbers by trying different weights for the transposed columns (Column 1 and Column 2). 

### Steps to Validate:
1. Remove hyphens from the numbers.
2. For each number, calculate the checksum using weights 1 and W.
3. Check if the calculated checksum matches the last digit of the number.
4. Record the valid weights and the index of the transposed columns.

### Example Calculation:
For the first number `9783541813919`:
- The digits are: 9, 7, 8, 3, 5, 4, 1, 8, 1, 3, 9
- The checksum digit is 9.

Using weights 1 and W:
- Sum = 9*1 + 7*W + 8*1 + 3*W + 5*1 + 4*W + 1*1 + 8*W + 1*1 + 3*W
- This simplifies to: (9 + 8 + 5 + 1 + 1) + (7 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 3)W = 24 + (25)W

We need to find W such that (24 + 25W) % 10 = 9.

### Validating Each Number:
We will repeat this process for each of the provided numbers and check for valid weights.

After performing the calculations for all numbers, we find the following valid weights and their corresponding indices:

1. For weight 1, index 1: Valid
2. For weight 2, index 1: Valid
3. For weight 3, index 1: Valid
4. For weight 4, index 1: Valid
5. For weight 5, index 1: Valid
6. For weight 6, index 1: Valid
7. For weight 7, index 1: Valid
8. For weight 8, index 1: Valid
9. For weight 9, index 1: Valid

### Conclusion:
The potential solutions for the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns are:

```
1, 1
2, 1
3, 1
4, 1
5, 1
6, 1
7, 1
8, 1
9, 1
```

Thus, the final answer is:
```
1, 1
2, 1
3, 1
4, 1
5, 1
6, 1
7, 1
8, 1
9, 1

</attached_docs>
Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true because they themselves are human.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," this statement must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the existence of vampires since they cannot exist without humans.

2. **Analyzing the Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement made by the humans is true.
   - If there are no humans, then the statement made by the vampires would be false, which creates a contradiction because vampires cannot exist without humans.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since every resident said "At least one of us is a human," and this statement can only be true if there is at least one human, it implies that there must be at least one human in the village.
   - If there were any vampires, they would have to lie, which would lead to the conclusion that there are no humans, creating a contradiction.

Thus, the only consistent scenario is that there are no vampires in the village of Șirnea. Therefore, the number of residents who have been turned into vampires is **0**.)

</attached_docs>
Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from your original destination (Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF) after going in the wrong direction, we need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the closest metro station is Smithsonian on the Orange, Silver, and Blue Lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Cleveland Park** station on the Red Line.
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow and Blue Lines.

Now, let's find the metro stations between these points:

- From **Smithsonian** to **Cleveland Park**: 
  - Smithsonian (Orange/Silver/Blue Line) → L'Enfant Plaza (transfer to Red Line) → Gallery Place (transfer to Red Line) → Metro Center (transfer to Red Line) → Cleveland Park (Red Line).
  
This route involves several transfers and stations, but since you mentioned not changing lines, we will consider the direct route on the Red Line.

- From **Cleveland Park** to **National Airport**:
  - Cleveland Park (Red Line) → Metro Center (transfer to Yellow/Blue Line) → National Airport (Yellow/Blue Line).

Since you are not changing lines, we will consider the distance in terms of the number of stations on the Red Line from Cleveland Park to the nearest transfer point (Metro Center) and then to National Airport.

However, since you are not changing lines, we will count the stations on the Red Line from Cleveland Park to the nearest station on the Yellow/Blue Line (which is at Metro Center).

1. **Cleveland Park** to **Metro Center**: 4 stations (Cleveland Park, Woodley Park, Dupont Circle, Farragut North).
2. **Metro Center** to **National Airport**: 2 stations (National Airport is directly accessible from the Yellow/Blue Line).

Thus, the total number of stations from Cleveland Park to National Airport, without changing lines, is:

- Cleveland Park to Metro Center: 4 stations
- Metro Center to National Airport: 2 stations

So, you are 4 stations away from your original destination if you don't change lines.

The answer is **4**.)

The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To solve the problem, we need to determine how the 30 coins can be distributed among the three boxes while adhering to the given constraints:

1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( x \leq y \leq z \). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \( x \geq 2 \).
- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \( z = y + 6 \).

Now, we can express the total number of coins as:
\[
x + y + z = 30
\]
Substituting \( z \) into the equation gives:
\[
x + y + (y + 6) = 30
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x + 2y + 6 = 30
\]
\[
x + 2y = 24
\]
\[
x = 24 - 2y
\]

Now, we need to ensure that \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are all non-negative integers. Since \( x \geq 2 \), we have:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Thus, \( y \) can take values from 1 to 11. However, since \( x \) must also be non-negative, we need to ensure \( 24 - 2y \geq 0 \):
\[
24 \geq 2y
\]
\[
12 \geq y
\]

So, \( y \) can take values from 1 to 12. However, since \( y \) must also be at least 2 (to ensure \( x \) is at least 2), we can narrow down the possible values for \( y \) to 2 through 11.

Now, we can calculate \( x \) and \( z \) for each valid \( y \):

- If \( y = 2 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(2) = 20 \)
  - \( z = y + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
  - Distribution: \( (20, 2, 8) \)

- If \( y = 3 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(3) = 18 \)
  - \( z = 3 + 6 = 9 \)
  - Distribution: \( (18, 3, 9) \)

- If \( y = 4 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(4) = 16 \)
  - \( z = 4 + 6 = 10 \)
  - Distribution: \( (16, 4, 10) \)

- If \( y = 5 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(5) = 14 \)
  - \( z = 5 + 6 = 11 \)
  - Distribution: \( (14, 5, 11) \)

- If \( y = 6 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(6) = 12 \)
  - \( z = 6 + 6 = 12 \)
  - Distribution: \( (12, 6, 12) \)

- If \( y = 7 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(7) = 10 \)
  - \( z = 7 + 6 = 13 \)
  - Distribution: \( (10, 7, 13) \)

- If \( y = 8 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8 \)
  - \( z = 8 + 6 = 14 \)
  - Distribution: \( (8, 8, 14) \)

- If \( y = 9 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6 \)
  - \( z = 9 + 6 = 15 \)
  - Distribution: \( (6, 9, 15) \)

- If \( y = 10 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4 \)
  - \( z = 10 + 6 = 16 \)
  - Distribution: \( (4, 10, 16) \)

- If \( y = 11 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2 \)
  - \( z = 11 + 6 = 17 \)
  - Distribution: \( (2, 11, 17) \)

Now, we have the following distributions of coins in the boxes:
1. (20, 2, 8)
2. (18, 3, 9)
3. (16, 4, 10)
4. (14, 5, 11)
5. (12, 6, 12)
6. (10, 7, 13)
7. (8, 8, 14)
8. (6, 9, 15)
9. (4, 10, 16)
10. (2, 11, 17)

To maximize his winnings, Bob should guess the number of coins in each box based on the distributions. The optimal strategy for Bob is to guess the minimum number of coins in each box that still allows him to win coins.

For each distribution, Bob can guess the following:
- For (20, 2, 8): Guess (20, 2, 8) → Wins 20 + 2 + 8 = 30
- For (18, 3, 9): Guess (18, 3, 9) → Wins 18 + 3 + 9 = 30
- For (16, 4, 10): Guess (16, 4, 10) → Wins 16 + 4 + 10 = 30
- For (14, 5, 11): Guess (14, 5, 11) → Wins 14 + 5 + 11 = 30
- For (12, 6, 12): Guess (12, 6, 12) → Wins 12 + 6 + 12 = 30
- For (10, 7, 13): Guess (10, 7, 13) → Wins 10 + 7 + 13 = 30
- For (8, 8, 14): Guess (8, 8, 14) → Wins 8 + 8 + 14 = 30
- For (6, 9, 15): Guess (6, 9, 15) → Wins 6 + 9 + 15 = 30
- For (4, 10, 16): Guess (4, 10, 16) → Wins 4 + 10 + 16 = 30
- For (2, 11, 17): Guess (2, 11, 17) → Wins 2 + 11 + 17 = 30

In all cases, Bob can win a total of 30 coins, which translates to $30,000.

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$30,000**.)

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 1.
   - 𒐚 represents the number 5.

So, 𒐐𒐚 represents the number 15.

Now, we can combine these values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) represents 10.
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) represents 15.

In the Babylonian system, the value is calculated as follows:
- The first symbol (10) is in the "60s" place (since it is the first symbol from the right), and the second symbol (15) is in the "1s" place.

Thus, the total value is:
\[ 10 \times 60^1 + 15 \times 60^0 = 10 \times 60 + 15 \times 1 = 600 + 15 = 615. \]

Therefore, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 is **615** in Arabic numerals.)

</attached_docs>
Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To determine the colors on the removed cube, we need to analyze the information provided about the Rubik's cube.

1. **Cubes with Faces**:
   - 6 face cubes (1 colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (2 colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (3 colored faces each)

2. **Cubes Found**:
   - All blue cubes have been found.
   - All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, below) have been found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corner cubes have been found, along with all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces.

### Analyzing the Colors:
- Since all blue cubes are found, blue is not a color on the removed cube.
- The orange center cube and its adjacent cubes are found, meaning all orange cubes are accounted for.
- All green corner cubes and green cubes bordering yellow are found, meaning green is also not a color on the removed cube.
- The opposite face of the orange cubes has been found, which means the cubes that are opposite to orange (which is red) are also accounted for.

### Remaining Colors:
The remaining colors on a standard Rubik's cube are:
- Yellow
- Red

Since the removed cube has two colors and we know that:
- Blue, Orange, Green, and Red (opposite of orange) are accounted for, the only colors left that can be on the removed cube are Yellow and Red.

### Conclusion:
The removed cube has the colors Yellow and Red. Therefore, the answer is:

**red, yellow**)
