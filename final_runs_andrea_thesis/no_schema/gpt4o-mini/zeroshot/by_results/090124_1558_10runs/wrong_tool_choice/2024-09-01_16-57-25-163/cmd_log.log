Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you should choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected first. 

Let's analyze the situation:

1. The first three balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3.
2. The pistons operate as follows:
   - If the first piston fires (ejects the ball in position 1), ball 1 is ejected, and balls 2 and 3 advance one space, with the next ball from the ramp (ball 4) entering position 3.
   - If the second piston fires (ejects the ball in position 2), ball 2 is ejected, ball 1 rolls away, ball 3 advances to position 1, and balls 4 and 5 enter positions 2 and 3.
   - If the third piston fires (ejects the ball in position 3), ball 3 is ejected, ball 1 rolls away, ball 2 advances to position 1, and balls 4 and 5 enter positions 2 and 3.

Now, let's consider the probabilities of each ball being ejected:

- Ball 1 can only be ejected if the first piston fires.
- Ball 2 can be ejected if the second piston fires.
- Ball 3 can be ejected if the third piston fires.

Since each piston fires randomly, each has an equal probability of firing. Therefore, the probability of each ball being ejected is as follows:

- Probability of ejecting ball 1: 1/3
- Probability of ejecting ball 2: 1/3
- Probability of ejecting ball 3: 1/3

However, if we consider the subsequent rounds, the situation changes. After the first round, if ball 1 is ejected, balls 2 and 3 will be in positions 1 and 2, respectively, and the next balls from the ramp will come in. If ball 2 is ejected, ball 3 will move to position 1, and the next balls will come in. If ball 3 is ejected, ball 2 will move to position 1, and the next balls will come in.

Given that the game continues until one ball is ejected, the best strategy is to choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected first. Since the first three balls are the only ones on the platform at the start, and they all have an equal chance of being ejected, you should choose one of these balls.

To maximize your odds, you should choose **ball 1**. This is because it is the first ball and will be ejected if the first piston fires, which is the simplest and most straightforward choice. 

So, the answer is: **1**.)

Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using a modified checksum calculation. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the digits. However, in this case, we have an unknown weight (let's call it `w`) for one of the columns.

2. **Identify the Structure**: The ISBN-13 format is typically structured as follows:
   - The first three digits are the prefix (usually 978 or 979).
   - The next digits represent the registration group, registrant, and publication.
   - The last digit is the checksum.

3. **Calculate the Checksum**: The checksum can be calculated as follows:
   - For a number represented as `d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 d9 d10 d11 d12 d13`, the checksum is:
     \[
     C = (d1 + w \cdot d2 + d3 + w \cdot d4 + d5 + w \cdot d6 + d7 + w \cdot d8 + d9 + w \cdot d10 + d11 + d12) \mod 10
     \]
   - The checksum digit `d13` should equal `C`.

4. **Iterate Over Possible Weights**: Since `w` can be any integer from 1 to 9, we will iterate through these values and check if the checksum condition holds for each ISBN.

5. **Identify the Transposed Columns**: Since the problem states that two adjacent columns have been transposed, we will need to check combinations of columns to see if swapping them results in a valid checksum.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the above logic in a systematic way:

```python
def calculate_checksum(isbn, weight):
    digits = [int(d) for d in isbn if d.isdigit()]
    checksum = 0
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1):  # Exclude the last digit (checksum)
        if i % 2 == 0:
            checksum += digits[i]  # Weight of 1
        else:
            checksum += weight * digits[i]  # Weight of w
    checksum = checksum % 10
    return checksum

def validate_isbn(isbn, weight):
    digits = [int(d) for d in isbn if d.isdigit()]
    calculated_checksum = calculate_checksum(isbn, weight)
    return calculated_checksum == digits[-1]

# List of ISBNs
isbns = [
    "978-354181391-9",
    "978-946669746-1",
    "978-398036139-6",
    "978-447656680-4",
    "978-279586664-7",
    "978-595073693-3",
    "978-976647652-6",
    "978-591178125-5",
    "978-728465924-5",
    "978-414825155-9"
]

# Check for each weight from 1 to 9
results = []
for weight in range(1, 10):
    for i in range(3, len(isbns[0]) - 1):  # Check columns from index 3 to second last
        for j in range(i + 1, len(isbns[0]) - 1):  # Check adjacent columns
            # Swap columns i and j
            modified_isbns = []
            for isbn in isbns:
                isbn_list = list(isbn)
                isbn_list[i], isbn_list[j] = isbn_list[j], isbn_list[i]  # Swap
                modified_isbns.append(''.join(isbn_list))
            
            # Validate all modified ISBNs
            if all(validate_isbn(modified_isbn, weight) for modified_isbn in modified_isbns):
                results.append((weight, i))

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion:

After running the above code, we would get the potential solutions in the form of `(weight, smaller index)`. Each valid combination of weight and index will be printed as a tuple. 

Please run the code in a suitable Python environment to get the exact results.)

Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," it must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the statement made by the vampire.

2. **Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement "At least one of us is a human" is true.
   - If there are no humans, then the statement would be false, which cannot happen because at least one resident (the vampire) would have to be lying about the existence of humans.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since all residents said "At least one of us is a human," and this statement can only be true if there is at least one human, it implies that there must be at least one human in the village.
   - If there were more than one vampire, they would still have to say the same statement, which would still hold true because at least one human exists.

4. **Final Count**:
   - The only scenario that fits is that there is exactly one vampire in the village. If there were more than one vampire, they would still have to acknowledge the existence of at least one human, which would lead to a contradiction if they were all vampires.

Thus, the conclusion is that **99 residents of Șirnea are humans, and 1 resident is a vampire**.)

Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF after going in the wrong direction, we need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the closest metro station is Smithsonian on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Cleveland Park** station on the Red Line.
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow/Blue lines.

Now, we need to find the number of stations between Cleveland Park and National Airport without changing lines.

- From **Cleveland Park** (Red Line), you would need to transfer to the **Yellow Line** at **Gallery Place** or **L'Enfant Plaza** to reach **National Airport**. However, since you specified not changing lines, we will consider the distance in terms of the Red Line.

The Red Line does not directly connect to National Airport, so we cannot count the stations directly. Instead, we can find the distance in terms of the stations on the Red Line to the nearest transfer point.

1. **Cleveland Park** to **Gallery Place** (transfer point):
   - Cleveland Park → Woodley Park → Dupont Circle → Farragut North → Gallery Place (5 stations)

2. From **Gallery Place**, you would transfer to the Yellow Line to reach National Airport.

Since you cannot change lines, you are effectively at **Cleveland Park** and need to reach **Gallery Place** to switch to the Yellow Line to get to National Airport.

Thus, you are **5 stations away** from your original destination if you don't change lines.

The answer is **5**.)



Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To solve the problem, we need to determine how the coins can be distributed among the three boxes while adhering to the given constraints:

1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.
3. The total number of coins is 30.

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( x \leq y \leq z \). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \( x \geq 2 \).
- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \( z = y + 6 \).

Now, we can express the total number of coins as:
\[
x + y + z = 30
\]
Substituting \( z \) into the equation gives:
\[
x + y + (y + 6) = 30
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x + 2y + 6 = 30
\]
\[
x + 2y = 24
\]
\[
x = 24 - 2y
\]

Now, we need to ensure that \( x \) is at least 2:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Since \( y \) must also be at least \( x \), we have \( y \geq 2 \). Thus, \( y \) can take values from 2 to 11.

Now, we can calculate \( x \) and \( z \) for each possible value of \( y \):

- If \( y = 2 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(2) = 20 \)
  - \( z = 2 + 6 = 8 \) (not valid since \( x \) must be the smallest)
  
- If \( y = 3 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(3) = 18 \)
  - \( z = 3 + 6 = 9 \) (not valid since \( x \) must be the smallest)
  
- If \( y = 4 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(4) = 16 \)
  - \( z = 4 + 6 = 10 \) (not valid since \( x \) must be the smallest)
  
- If \( y = 5 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(5) = 14 \)
  - \( z = 5 + 6 = 11 \) (not valid since \( x \) must be the smallest)
  
- If \( y = 6 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(6) = 12 \)
  - \( z = 6 + 6 = 12 \) (not valid since \( x \) must be the smallest)
  
- If \( y = 7 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(7) = 10 \)
  - \( z = 7 + 6 = 13 \) (valid: \( x = 10, y = 7, z = 13 \))
  
- If \( y = 8 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8 \)
  - \( z = 8 + 6 = 14 \) (valid: \( x = 8, y = 8, z = 14 \))
  
- If \( y = 9 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6 \)
  - \( z = 9 + 6 = 15 \) (valid: \( x = 6, y = 9, z = 15 \))
  
- If \( y = 10 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4 \)
  - \( z = 10 + 6 = 16 \) (valid: \( x = 4, y = 10, z = 16 \))
  
- If \( y = 11 \): 
  - \( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2 \)
  - \( z = 11 + 6 = 17 \) (valid: \( x = 2, y = 11, z = 17 \))

Now we have the valid distributions:
1. \( (10, 7, 13) \)
2. \( (8, 8, 14) \)
3. \( (6, 9, 15) \)
4. \( (4, 10, 16) \)
5. \( (2, 11, 17) \)

Next, we need to determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy. Bob should guess in a way that maximizes his winnings while minimizing his losses. 

A reasonable strategy is to guess the average number of coins in each box. The average number of coins per box is \( 30 / 3 = 10 \). 

If Bob guesses \( (10, 10, 10) \):
- For \( (10, 7, 13) \): He wins 10 coins.
- For \( (8, 8, 14) \): He wins 8 coins.
- For \( (6, 9, 15) \): He wins 6 coins.
- For \( (4, 10, 16) \): He wins 4 coins.
- For \( (2, 11, 17) \): He wins 2 coins.

The minimum amount he can win from these distributions is 2 coins, which corresponds to the distribution \( (2, 11, 17) \).

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is:
\[
\text{Minimum winnings} = 2 \text{ coins} \times 1000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\])

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 1 (in the tens place, or 60^1).
   - 𒐚 represents the number 5 (in the units place, or 60^0).

Now, we can calculate the value of the second symbol:
- 𒐐𒐚 = 1 * 60 + 5 = 60 + 5 = 65.

Now, we combine the values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) is 10.
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) is 65.

Finally, we add these two values together:
10 + 65 = 75.

Thus, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in Arabic numerals is **75**.)

   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces.
   - Since all blue cubes are found, blue cannot be one of the colors on the removed cube.
   - The orange center cube and its adjacent cubes are found, meaning all orange cubes are accounted for.
   - All green corner cubes and green cubes bordering yellow are found, meaning green is also accounted for.
   - The remaining colors on a standard Rubik's cube are yellow and red.

Since the removed cube has two colors and all other colors (blue, orange, green) are accounted for, the only possible colors left are yellow and red.

Thus, the colors on the removed cube are:

**red, yellow**)
