Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you should choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected first. 

Let's analyze the situation:

1. The first three balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3.
2. The pistons operate as follows:
   - If the first piston fires, it ejects ball 1, and balls 2 and 3 advance, with the next ball from the ramp (ball 4) entering the third position.
   - If the second piston fires, it ejects ball 2, and ball 3 moves to the first position, with balls 4 and 5 entering the second and third positions.
   - If the third piston fires, it ejects ball 3, and ball 2 moves to the first position, with balls 4 and 5 entering the second and third positions.

Now, let's consider the probabilities of each ball being ejected:

- Ball 1 can only be ejected if the first piston fires.
- Ball 2 can be ejected if the second piston fires.
- Ball 3 can be ejected if the third piston fires.

Since each piston fires randomly and independently, each piston has an equal probability of firing. Therefore, the probability of each ball being ejected is as follows:

- Probability of ejecting ball 1 = 1/3
- Probability of ejecting ball 2 = 1/3
- Probability of ejecting ball 3 = 1/3

Since all three balls have the same probability of being ejected, you can choose any of the three balls (1, 2, or 3) to maximize your odds of winning. However, since you want to pick a ball that is guaranteed to be on the platform at the start, you should choose **ball 1**.

So, the best choice is to select **ball 1**.)

Solving question 50:
Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using a modified checksum calculation. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: 
   - The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the digits, but in this case, we will use weights of 1 and an unknown weight \( w \) for the digits in the transposed columns.

2. **Identify the Structure**: 
   - The first three columns are fixed, and the last column is the checksum. The columns that are transposed are between the 4th and 10th columns.

3. **Calculate the Checksum**:
   - For each number, we will calculate the checksum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Checksum} = (d_0 \cdot 1 + d_1 \cdot w + d_2 \cdot 1 + d_3 \cdot w + d_4 \cdot 1 + d_5 \cdot w + d_6 \cdot 1 + d_7 \cdot w + d_8 \cdot 1 + d_9 \cdot w) \mod 10
     \]
   - The checksum digit should equal \( 10 - \text{Checksum} \mod 10 \).

4. **Iterate Over Possible Weights**:
   - We will iterate over possible weights \( w \) from 1 to 9 and check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit for each number.

5. **Identify the Transposed Columns**:
   - We will assume the transposed columns are the 4th and 5th columns (index 3 and 4) and check if the validation holds for each possible weight.

### Implementation:

Let's calculate the checksums for each number with the transposed columns and find valid weights.

```python
def calculate_checksum(isbn, weight):
    digits = [int(d) for d in isbn if d.isdigit()]
    checksum = 0
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1):  # Exclude the last digit (checksum)
        if i % 2 == 0:
            checksum += digits[i] * 1
        else:
            checksum += digits[i] * weight
    return (10 - (checksum % 10)) % 10

# List of ISBNs
isbns = [
    "9783541813919",
    "9789466697461",
    "9783980361396",
    "9784476566804",
    "9782795866647",
    "9785950736933",
    "9789766476526",
    "9785911781255",
    "9787284659245",
    "9784148251559"
]

# Check for weights from 1 to 9
results = []
for weight in range(1, 10):
    for isbn in isbns:
        calculated_checksum = calculate_checksum(isbn, weight)
        if calculated_checksum == int(isbn[-1]):  # Compare with the last digit
            results.append((weight, 3))  # Assuming columns 3 and 4 are transposed

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion:

After running the above logic, we would find the valid weights and the index of the smaller transposed column. The output will be in the form \( x, y \) where \( x \) is the weight and \( y \) is the smaller index of the two transposed columns (which is 3 in this case). 

The final output will depend on the results of the calculations.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true, and there is at least one human among them.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," it must be false. This means that there are no humans among them, which contradicts the existence of vampires since they must have been humans at some point.

2. **Analyzing the Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement made by the humans is true.
   - If all residents were vampires, then the statement "At least one of us is a human" would be false, which is a contradiction because vampires must have been humans before being turned.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since every resident said "At least one of us is a human," and this statement cannot be false (as it would imply there are no humans, which is impossible if they are all vampires), it follows that there must be at least one human in the village.
   - Therefore, the only way for the statement to hold true is if there is at least one human and the rest are vampires.

Given that there are 100 residents in total, and at least one of them is a human, the maximum number of vampires that can exist in the village is 99.

Thus, the number of residents of Șirnea who have been turned into vampires is **99**.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF after going in the wrong direction, we need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the closest metro station is Smithsonian on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The closest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Cleveland Park** station on the Red Line.
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow/Blue lines.

Now, let's find the route:

- From **Smithsonian** to **Cleveland Park**: You would travel on the Orange or Blue line towards the direction of New Carrollton or Largo Town Center, and then transfer to the Red Line at Gallery Place-Chinatown to go towards Glenmont.
- From **Cleveland Park** to **National Airport**: You would need to go back to Gallery Place-Chinatown, transfer to the Yellow or Blue line, and then head towards National Airport.

Now, let's count the stations:

1. **From Smithsonian to Cleveland Park**:
   - Smithsonian → L'Enfant Plaza → Federal Center SW → Capitol South → Eastern Market → Potomac Ave → Stadium-Armory → Minnesota Ave → Benning Road → Capitol Heights → Addison Road → Largo Town Center → New Carrollton (if you go the wrong way).
   - This is approximately 10 stations away.

2. **From Cleveland Park to National Airport**:
   - Cleveland Park → Woodley Park-Zoo → Dupont Circle → Farragut North → Gallery Place-Chinatown → L'Enfant Plaza → National Airport.
   - This is approximately 6 stations away.

Now, if you add the two segments together, you would be approximately 16 stations away from your original destination if you don't change lines.

However, since you are only interested in how many stations you are away from your original destination after going in the wrong direction, you would only consider the distance from Cleveland Park to National Airport.

Thus, the answer is:

**6**)



Solving question 123:
Query: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

Row 123: Incorrect (Expected: 16000, Got: To solve the problem, we need to determine how the coins can be distributed among the three boxes while adhering to the given constraints:

1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.
3. The total number of coins is 30.

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( x \leq y \leq z \). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \( x \geq 2 \).
- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \( z = y + 6 \).

Now, we can express the total number of coins as:
\[
x + y + z = 30
\]
Substituting \( z \) into the equation gives:
\[
x + y + (y + 6) = 30
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x + 2y + 6 = 30
\]
\[
x + 2y = 24
\]
\[
x = 24 - 2y
\]

Now, we need to ensure that \( x \) is at least 2:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Since \( y \) must also be at least \( x \) (because \( x \leq y \)), we have:
\[
y \geq 2
\]

Now we can find the possible values for \( y \):
- If \( y = 2 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(2) = 20 \) and \( z = 2 + 6 = 8 \) (not valid since \( x \) must be the smallest).
- If \( y = 3 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(3) = 18 \) and \( z = 3 + 6 = 9 \) (not valid).
- If \( y = 4 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(4) = 16 \) and \( z = 4 + 6 = 10 \) (not valid).
- If \( y = 5 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(5) = 14 \) and \( z = 5 + 6 = 11 \) (not valid).
- If \( y = 6 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(6) = 12 \) and \( z = 6 + 6 = 12 \) (valid).
- If \( y = 7 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(7) = 10 \) and \( z = 7 + 6 = 13 \) (valid).
- If \( y = 8 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8 \) and \( z = 8 + 6 = 14 \) (valid).
- If \( y = 9 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6 \) and \( z = 9 + 6 = 15 \) (valid).
- If \( y = 10 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4 \) and \( z = 10 + 6 = 16 \) (valid).
- If \( y = 11 \), then \( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2 \) and \( z = 11 + 6 = 17 \) (valid).

Now we have the following valid distributions:
1. \( (12, 12, 6) \)
2. \( (10, 13, 7) \)
3. \( (8, 14, 8) \)
4. \( (6, 15, 9) \)
5. \( (4, 16, 10) \)
6. \( (2, 17, 11) \)

Next, we need to determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy. The goal is to minimize the amount he can win. 

If Bob guesses the maximum number of coins in each box, he will win the maximum possible coins. However, to minimize his winnings, he should guess lower values. 

A reasonable strategy for Bob is to guess the minimum number of coins in each box based on the distributions. 

For example, if he guesses:
- Box 1: 2 coins
- Box 2: 6 coins
- Box 3: 12 coins

In this case, he will win coins from the boxes that have at least that many coins. 

After analyzing the distributions and guessing strategies, the minimum amount Bob can win is determined by the lowest possible guess that still allows him to win coins from the boxes. 

If Bob guesses optimally, he can minimize his winnings to:
- Box 1: 2 coins (if it has 2 or more)
- Box 2: 6 coins (if it has 6 or more)
- Box 3: 12 coins (if it has 12 or more)

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, given the optimal strategy, is **$20,000**.)

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 1 (in the 60s place).
   - 𒐚 represents the number 5 (in the units place).

So, 𒐐𒐚 represents \(1 \times 60 + 5 = 65\).

Now, we can combine these values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) is 10.
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) is 65.

To find the total value, we add these two numbers together:
\[ 10 + 65 = 75 \]

Therefore, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in Arabic numerals is **75**.)

</attached_docs>
Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To determine the colors on the removed cube, we need to analyze the information provided about the Rubik's cube.

1. **Cubes with Faces**:
   - There are 6 face cubes (one colored face each).
   - There are 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each).
   - There are 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each).

2. **Cubes Found**:
   - All blue cubes have been found.
   - All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, below) have been found, along with the center cube itself.
   - All green corner cubes have been found, as well as all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Color Relationships**:
   - The orange center cube is surrounded by edge and corner cubes. Since all adjacent cubes have been found, this means that the edge and corner cubes adjacent to the orange center are accounted for.
   - The green corners and green cubes bordering yellow being found suggests that the yellow face is also accounted for.

4. **Identifying the Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces.
   - Since all blue, green, and orange cubes have been accounted for, and the opposite face's cubes for orange have also been found, we can deduce that the removed cube cannot be orange, blue, or green.
   - The remaining colors on a standard Rubik's cube are red and yellow.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The removed cube must be an edge cube, as it has two colored faces.
   - Given that all orange and blue cubes are found, and green cubes bordering yellow are found, the only two colors left that can be on the removed cube are red and yellow.

Thus, the colors on the removed cube are:

**red, yellow**)
