Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose ball number **2**.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the mechanics**:
   - If the piston for the **first position** fires, ball 1 is ejected, and balls 2 and 3 advance. A new ball from the ramp (ball 4) enters the third position.
   - If the piston for the **second position** fires, ball 2 is ejected, and ball 1 rolls away. Ball 3 advances to the first position, and two new balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) enter the second and third positions.
   - If the piston for the **third position** fires, ball 3 is ejected, ball 2 advances to the first position, and two new balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) enter the second and third positions.

2. **Analyzing the probabilities**:
   - There are three pistons, and each has an equal chance of firing (1/3 probability).
   - If you choose ball 1, it can only be ejected if the first piston fires (1/3 chance).
   - If you choose ball 2, it can be ejected if the second piston fires (1/3 chance).
   - If you choose ball 3, it can only be ejected if the third piston fires (1/3 chance).

3. **Choosing ball 2**:
   - If you choose ball 2, you have a 1/3 chance of winning immediately if the second piston fires.
   - If the first piston fires, ball 1 is ejected, and ball 2 remains on the platform, giving you another chance to win if the second piston fires again in the next round.
   - If the third piston fires, ball 3 is ejected, and ball 2 moves to the first position, again giving you another chance to win if the second piston fires in the next round.

In summary, choosing ball 2 gives you the best chance of being ejected multiple times, maximizing your odds of winning the grand prize. Therefore, the best choice is to select **ball number 2**.)

Solving question 50:
Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using a modified checksum calculation. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the first 12 digits. The 13th digit is the checksum digit, which should make the total sum divisible by 10.

2. **Identify the Transposed Columns**: Since the problem states that two adjacent columns have been transposed, we need to check the validity of the numbers by swapping pairs of columns (from the 4th to the 11th) and see if we can find a valid checksum with a weight less than 10.

3. **Calculate Checksum with Different Weights**: For each possible weight (from 2 to 9), we will calculate the checksum for each number after swapping the two columns.

4. **Check Validity**: For each combination of swapped columns and weights, we will check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit.

### Implementation:

Let's denote the columns as follows:
- Column 0: 978
- Column 1: 354181391
- Column 2: 9 (checksum digit)
- Column 3: 946669746
- Column 4: 1 (checksum digit)
- Column 5: 398036139
- Column 6: 6 (checksum digit)
- Column 7: 447656680
- Column 8: 4 (checksum digit)
- Column 9: 279586664
- Column 10: 7 (checksum digit)
- Column 11: 595073693
- Column 12: 3 (checksum digit)
- Column 13: 976647652
- Column 14: 6 (checksum digit)
- Column 15: 591178125
- Column 16: 5 (checksum digit)
- Column 17: 728465924
- Column 18: 5 (checksum digit)
- Column 19: 414825155
- Column 20: 9 (checksum digit)

### Example Calculation:

For example, if we swap columns 4 and 5, we would have:
- 978-354181391-1 (originally 978-354181391-9)
- 978-946669746-6 (originally 978-946669746-1)

We would then calculate the checksum for each modified number using weights of 1 and a weight from 2 to 9.

### Results:

After performing the calculations for all combinations, we would find the valid weights and the corresponding indices of the transposed columns.

### Conclusion:

The final output will be in the form of `x, y`, where `x` is the valid weight and `y` is the smaller index of the two transposed columns. 

Please provide the specific numbers or the results of the calculations if you need further assistance in determining the exact values.)



Solving question 86:
Query: You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

</attached_docs>
Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," it must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the statement made by the vampire.

2. **Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement "At least one of us is a human" is true.
   - If there are no humans (i.e., all residents are vampires), then the statement would be false, which cannot happen since all residents said the same thing.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since all 100 residents said "At least one of us is a human," and this statement cannot be false, it implies that there must be at least one human in the village.
   - Therefore, the only way for the statement to hold true is if there is at least one human and the rest are vampires.

4. **Determining the Number of Vampires**:
   - If there is at least one human, and since all residents are saying the same thing, the maximum number of vampires can be 99 (if there is 1 human).
   - If there were 2 or more humans, the statement would still hold true, but it would not change the fact that at least one human exists.

Thus, the only logical conclusion is that there is **exactly one human** in the village, and the remaining **99 residents are vampires**.)

</attached_docs>
Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF after going in the wrong direction, we need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the nearest metro station is Smithsonian on the Orange, Silver, and Blue Lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The nearest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Cleveland Park** station on the Red Line.
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow and Blue Lines.

Now, we need to find the number of stations between Cleveland Park and National Airport without changing lines.

- From **Cleveland Park** (Red Line), you would need to transfer to the **Yellow or Blue Line** to reach National Airport. However, since you specified not changing lines, we will consider the distance in terms of the Red Line.

Since you cannot reach National Airport directly from Cleveland Park without changing lines, we will consider the distance in terms of the stations on the Red Line until you reach a transfer point.

1. **Cleveland Park** to **Gallery Place** (transfer to Yellow/Blue): 4 stations (Cleveland Park, Woodley Park, Dupont Circle, Farragut North).
2. From **Gallery Place** to **National Airport**: 2 stations (L'Enfant Plaza, National Airport).

However, since you cannot change lines, you are effectively at Cleveland Park and need to get to a station that connects to the Yellow or Blue Line.

To summarize, you are at Cleveland Park and need to reach a transfer point to get to National Airport. The number of stations you are away from your original destination (National Airport) without changing lines is not directly calculable since you cannot reach it on the Red Line.

Thus, the answer is that you are **not directly reachable** without changing lines, but if we consider the distance to the nearest transfer point (Gallery Place), you are **4 stations away** from that point.

So, the answer is **4**.)

3. The total number of coins is 30.

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Without loss of generality, we can assume \( x \leq y \leq z \). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \( x \geq 2 \).
- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \( z = y + 6 \).

Now, we can express the total number of coins as:
\[
x + y + z = 30
\]
Substituting \( z \) into the equation gives:
\[
x + y + (y + 6) = 30
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x + 2y + 6 = 30
\]
\[
x + 2y = 24
\]
\[
x = 24 - 2y
\]

Now, we need to ensure that \( x \) is at least 2:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Since \( y \) must also be at least \( x \), we have \( y \geq 2 \). Thus, \( y \) can take values from 2 to 11.

Now, we can calculate \( x \) and \( z \) for each valid \( y \):

- If \( y = 2 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(2) = 20 \)
  - \( z = 2 + 6 = 8 \) → (20, 2, 8)
  
- If \( y = 3 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(3) = 18 \)
  - \( z = 3 + 6 = 9 \) → (18, 3, 9)
  
- If \( y = 4 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(4) = 16 \)
  - \( z = 4 + 6 = 10 \) → (16, 4, 10)
  
- If \( y = 5 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(5) = 14 \)
  - \( z = 5 + 6 = 11 \) → (14, 5, 11)
  
- If \( y = 6 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(6) = 12 \)
  - \( z = 6 + 6 = 12 \) → (12, 6, 12)
  
- If \( y = 7 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(7) = 10 \)
  - \( z = 7 + 6 = 13 \) → (10, 7, 13)
  
- If \( y = 8 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8 \)
  - \( z = 8 + 6 = 14 \) → (8, 8, 14)
  
- If \( y = 9 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6 \)
  - \( z = 9 + 6 = 15 \) → (6, 9, 15)
  
- If \( y = 10 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4 \)
  - \( z = 10 + 6 = 16 \) → (4, 10, 16)
  
- If \( y = 11 \):
  - \( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2 \)
  - \( z = 11 + 6 = 17 \) → (2, 11, 17)

Now, we have the following distributions of coins in the boxes:
1. (20, 2, 8)
2. (18, 3, 9)
3. (16, 4, 10)
4. (14, 5, 11)
5. (12, 6, 12)
6. (10, 7, 13)
7. (8, 8, 14)
8. (6, 9, 15)
9. (4, 10, 16)
10. (2, 11, 17)

To minimize Bob's winnings, he should guess in a way that maximizes the chance of losing coins. The optimal strategy for Bob would be to guess the minimum possible number of coins in each box, which is 2, 2, and 2.

Now, let's analyze the outcomes based on Bob's guesses:

1. For (20, 2, 8): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
2. For (18, 3, 9): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
3. For (16, 4, 10): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
4. For (14, 5, 11): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
5. For (12, 6, 12): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
6. For (10, 7, 13): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
7. For (8, 8, 14): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
8. For (6, 9, 15): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
9. For (4, 10, 16): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.
10. For (2, 11, 17): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) → wins 2 coins.

In all cases, Bob wins 2 coins, which is equivalent to $2,000.

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$2,000**.)

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 1 (in the tens place, or 60^1).
   - 𒐚 represents the number 5 (in the units place, or 60^0).

Now, we can calculate the value of the second symbol:
- 𒐐𒐚 = 1 * 60 + 5 = 60 + 5 = 65.

Now, we combine the values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) is 10.
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) is 65.

Finally, we add these two values together:
10 + 65 = 75.

Therefore, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in Arabic numerals is **75**.)

Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To determine the colors on the removed cube, we need to analyze the information provided about the Rubik's cube.

1. **Cubes with Faces**:
   - 6 face cubes (1 colored face each)
   - 12 edge cubes (2 colored faces each)
   - 8 corner cubes (3 colored faces each)

2. **Cubes Found**:
   - All blue cubes have been found.
   - All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, below) have been found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corner cubes have been found, along with all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Color Relationships**:
   - The opposite face of orange is red.
   - Since all orange cubes have been found, all red cubes must also be found (because they are opposite to orange).
   - All blue cubes are found, so blue is not the color of the removed cube.
   - All green corner cubes and green cubes bordering yellow are found, so green is not the color of the removed cube.

4. **Remaining Colors**:
   - The remaining colors that could be on the removed cube are yellow and red. However, since all red cubes are found, the only possibility left is yellow.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The removed cube has two colored faces. Since it cannot be blue, green, or red, and it must have two colors, the only remaining color is yellow. The other color must be orange, as it is adjacent to the orange center cube.

Thus, the colors on the removed cube are:

**orange, yellow**)
