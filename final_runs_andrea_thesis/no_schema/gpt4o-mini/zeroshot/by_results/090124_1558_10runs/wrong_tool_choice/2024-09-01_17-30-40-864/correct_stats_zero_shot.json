        "returned_answer": "To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose ball number **2**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the mechanics**:\n   - If the piston for the **first position** fires, ball 1 is ejected, and balls 2 and 3 advance. A new ball from the ramp (ball 4) enters the third position.\n   - If the piston for the **second position** fires, ball 2 is ejected, and ball 1 rolls away. Ball 3 advances to the first position, and two new balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) enter the second and third positions.\n   - If the piston for the **third position** fires, ball 3 is ejected, ball 2 advances to the first position, and two new balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) enter the second and third positions.\n\n2. **Analyzing the probabilities**:\n   - There are three pistons, and each has an equal chance of firing (1/3 probability).\n   - If you choose ball 1, it can only be ejected if the first piston fires (1/3 chance).\n   - If you choose ball 2, it can be ejected if the second piston fires (1/3 chance).\n   - If you choose ball 3, it can only be ejected if the third piston fires (1/3 chance).\n\n3. **Choosing ball 2**:\n   - If you choose ball 2, you have a 1/3 chance of winning immediately if the second piston fires.\n   - If the first piston fires, ball 1 is ejected, and ball 2 remains on the platform, giving you another chance to win if the second piston fires again in the next round.\n   - If the third piston fires, ball 3 is ejected, and ball 2 moves to the first position, again giving you another chance to win if the second piston fires in the next round.\n\nIn summary, choosing ball 2 gives you the best chance of being ejected multiple times, maximizing your odds of winning the grand prize. Therefore, the best choice is to select **ball number 2**.",

The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the first 12 digits. The 13th digit is the checksum digit, which should make the total sum divisible by 10.\n\n2. **Identify the Transposed Columns**: Since the problem states that two adjacent columns have been transposed, we need to check the validity of the numbers by swapping pairs of columns (from the 4th to the 11th) and see if we can find a valid checksum with a weight less than 10.\n\n3. **Calculate Checksum with Different Weights**: For each possible weight (from 2 to 9), we will calculate the checksum for each number after swapping the two columns.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each combination of swapped columns and weights, we will check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's denote the columns as follows:\n- Column 0: 978\n- Column 1: 354181391\n- Column 2: 9 (checksum digit)\n- Column 3: 946669746\n- Column 4: 1 (checksum digit)\n- Column 5: 398036139\n- Column 6: 6 (checksum digit)\n- Column 7: 447656680\n- Column 8: 4 (checksum digit)\n- Column 9: 279586664\n- Column 10: 7 (checksum digit)\n- Column 11: 595073693\n- Column 12: 3 (checksum digit)\n- Column 13: 976647652\n- Column 14: 6 (checksum digit)\n- Column 15: 591178125\n- Column 16: 5 (checksum digit)\n- Column 17: 728465924\n- Column 18: 5 (checksum digit)\n- Column 19: 414825155\n- Column 20: 9 (checksum digit)\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nFor example, if we swap columns 4 and 5, we would have:\n- 978-354181391-1 (originally 978-354181391-9)\n- 978-946669746-6 (originally 978-946669746-1)\n\nWe would then calculate the checksum for each modified number using weights of 1 and a weight from 2 to 9.\n\n### Results:\n\nAfter performing the calculations for all combinations, we would find the valid weights and the corresponding indices of the transposed columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe final output will be in the form of `x, y`, where `x` is the valid weight and `y` is the smaller index of the two transposed columns. \n\nPlease provide the specific numbers or the results of the calculations if you need further assistance in determining the exact values.",

Each resident answered, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Responses**:\n   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say \"At least one of us is a human,\" it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.\n   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says \"At least one of us is a human,\" it must be false.

One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n3. The total number of coins is 30.\n\nLet's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\). Without loss of generality, we can assume \\( x \\leq y \\leq z \\). \n\nFrom the constraints, we can derive the following:\n\n- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \\( z = y + 6 \\).\n\nNow, we can express the total number of coins as:\n\\[\nx + y + z = 30\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( z \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\nx + y + (y + 6) = 30\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx + 2y + 6 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2y = 24\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 24 - 2y\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to ensure that \\( x \\) is at least 2:\n\\[\n24 - 2y \\geq 2\n\\]\n\\[\n24 - 2 \\geq 2y\n\\]\n\\[\n22 \\geq 2y\n\\]\n\\[\n11 \\geq y\n\\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) must also be at least \\( x \\), we have \\( y \\geq 2 \\). Thus, \\( y \\) can take values from 2 to 11.\n\nNow, we can calculate \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) for each valid \\( y \\):\n\n- If \\( y = 2 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(2) = 20 \\)\n  - \\( z = 2 + 6 = 8 \\) \u2192 (20, 2, 8)\n  \n- If \\( y = 3 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(3) = 18 \\)\n  - \\( z = 3 + 6 = 9 \\) \u2192 (18, 3, 9)\n  \n- If \\( y = 4 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(4) = 16 \\)\n  - \\( z = 4 + 6 = 10 \\) \u2192 (16, 4, 10)\n  \n- If \\( y = 5 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(5) = 14 \\)\n  - \\( z = 5 + 6 = 11 \\) \u2192 (14, 5, 11)\n  \n- If \\( y = 6 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(6) = 12 \\)\n  - \\( z = 6 + 6 = 12 \\) \u2192 (12, 6, 12)\n  \n- If \\( y = 7 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(7) = 10 \\)\n  - \\( z = 7 + 6 = 13 \\) \u2192 (10, 7, 13)\n  \n- If \\( y = 8 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8 \\)\n  - \\( z = 8 + 6 = 14 \\) \u2192 (8, 8, 14)\n  \n- If \\( y = 9 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6 \\)\n  - \\( z = 9 + 6 = 15 \\) \u2192 (6, 9, 15)\n  \n- If \\( y = 10 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4 \\)\n  - \\( z = 10 + 6 = 16 \\) \u2192 (4, 10, 16)\n  \n- If \\( y = 11 \\):\n  - \\( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2 \\)\n  - \\( z = 11 + 6 = 17 \\) \u2192 (2, 11, 17)\n\nNow, we have the following distributions of coins in the boxes:\n1. (20, 2, 8)\n2. (18, 3, 9)\n3. (16, 4, 10)\n4. (14, 5, 11)\n5. (12, 6, 12)\n6. (10, 7, 13)\n7. (8, 8, 14)\n8. (6, 9, 15)\n9. (4, 10, 16)\n10.

The optimal strategy for Bob would be to guess the minimum possible number of coins in each box, which is 2, 2, and 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the outcomes based on Bob's guesses:\n\n1. For (20, 2, 8): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n2. For (18, 3, 9): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n3. For (16, 4, 10): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n4. For (14, 5, 11): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n5. For (12, 6, 12): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n6. For (10, 7, 13): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n7.

For (2, 11, 17): Bob guesses (2, 2, 2) \u2192 wins 2 coins.\n\nIn all cases, Bob wins 2 coins, which is equivalent to $2,000.\n\nThus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$2,000**.",
