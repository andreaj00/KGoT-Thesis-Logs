Solving question 9:
Query: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

Row 9: Incorrect (Expected: 3, Got: To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize in the game "Pick That Ping-Pong," you should choose the ball that is most likely to be ejected first. 

Let's analyze the situation:

1. The first three balls on the platform are 1, 2, and 3.
2. The pistons operate as follows:
   - If the first piston fires (ejects the ball in position 1), balls in positions 2 and 3 advance one space, and the next ball from the ramp (ball 4) takes position 3.
   - If the second piston fires (ejects the ball in position 2), the ball in position 1 is released, the ball in position 3 advances to position 1, and the next two balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) take positions 2 and 3.
   - If the third piston fires (ejects the ball in position 3), the ball in position 1 is released, the ball in position 2 advances to position 1, and the next two balls from the ramp (balls 4 and 5) take positions 2 and 3.

Now, let's consider the probabilities of each ball being ejected:

- **Ball 1**: If the first piston fires, ball 1 is ejected. If the second or third piston fires, ball 1 is not ejected.
- **Ball 2**: If the second piston fires, ball 2 is ejected. If the first or third piston fires, ball 2 is not ejected.
- **Ball 3**: If the third piston fires, ball 3 is ejected. If the first or second piston fires, ball 3 is not ejected.

Since each piston fires randomly, each has an equal probability of firing (1/3). Therefore, the probabilities of each ball being ejected are:

- Probability of ejecting ball 1: 1/3
- Probability of ejecting ball 2: 1/3
- Probability of ejecting ball 3: 1/3

Since all three balls have the same probability of being ejected, you can choose any of the three balls (1, 2, or 3) to maximize your odds of winning. 

However, since the game starts with balls 1, 2, and 3, and you want to ensure you have the best chance of being ejected first, you should choose **ball 1**. This is because it is the first ball in the sequence and is ejected immediately if the first piston fires.

Thus, the best choice is:

**1**)

Query: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

Row 62: Incorrect (Expected: 7, 9, Got: To solve the problem, we need to validate the provided numbers using a modified checksum calculation. The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: 
   - The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the digits, but in this case, we will use weights of 1 and an unknown weight \( w \) for the digits in the transposed columns.

2. **Identify the Structure**: 
   - The first three columns are fixed, and the last column is the checksum. The columns that are transposed are between the 4th and the 10th columns.

3. **Calculate the Checksum**:
   - For each number, we will calculate the checksum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Checksum} = (d_1 + d_2 \cdot w + d_3 + d_4 \cdot w + d_5 + d_6 \cdot w + d_7 + d_8 \cdot w + d_9 + d_{10} \cdot w) \mod 10
     \]
   - The checksum digit should equal \( (10 - \text{Checksum} \mod 10) \mod 10 \).

4. **Iterate Over Possible Weights**:
   - We will iterate over possible weights \( w \) from 1 to 9 and check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit.

5. **Check Each Number**:
   - For each number, we will check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum for each weight.

### Implementation:

Let's analyze the provided numbers:

1. **978-354181391-9**
2. **978-946669746-1**
3. **978-398036139-6**
4. **978-447656680-4**
5. **978-279586664-7**
6. **978-595073693-3**
7. **978-976647652-6**
8. **978-591178125-5**
9. **978-728465924-5**
10. **978-414825155-9**

### Example Calculation:

For the first number, "978-354181391-9":
- The digits are: 9, 7, 8, 3, 5, 4, 1, 8, 3, 9, 1
- The checksum digit is 9.

We will calculate the checksum for weights from 1 to 9 and see if any match.

### Results:

After performing the calculations for each number and each weight, we find the following potential solutions:

- For weight \( w = 3 \) and the smaller index of the two transposed columns being 4, the checksum matches for multiple numbers.
- For weight \( w = 4 \) and the smaller index of the two transposed columns being 4, the checksum matches for multiple numbers.

### Final Answer:

The potential solutions are:
- **3, 4**
- **4, 4**

Thus, the final answer is:
```
3, 4
4, 4
``` 

Please note that the specific numbers that validate with these weights would need to be checked against the original data to confirm the transposition.)

</attached_docs>
Row 86: Incorrect (Expected: 100, Got: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the responses given by the residents of Șirnea. Each resident answered, "At least one of us is a human."

1. **Understanding the Responses**:
   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say "At least one of us is a human," it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.
   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says "At least one of us is a human," it must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the statement made by the vampire.

2. **Implications**:
   - If there is at least one human in the village, then the statement made by the humans is true.
   - If there are no humans, then the statement made by the vampires would also be true, which is a contradiction since vampires cannot tell the truth.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The only scenario that fits is that there is at least one human in the village. Since all residents said the same thing, and the statement cannot be false, it implies that there must be at least one human.
   - If there were more than one vampire, they would still have to lie, and their statement would lead to a contradiction.

Thus, the only logical conclusion is that there is exactly **one vampire** in the village of Șirnea, and the rest of the residents are humans. Therefore, the number of residents of Șirnea who have been turned into vampires is **1**.)

Row 109: Incorrect (Expected: 8, Got: To determine how many metro stations you are away from Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF after going in the wrong direction, we first need to identify the metro stations involved.

1. **Starting Point**: National Air and Space Museum (the nearest metro station is Smithsonian on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines).
2. **Wrong Direction**: You end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. The nearest metro station to Cleveland Elementary School is likely the **Eastern Market** station (also on the Blue/Orange/Silver lines).
3. **Destination**: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located near the **Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)**, which is served by the **National Airport** station on the Yellow and Blue lines.

Now, let's find the route from Eastern Market to National Airport:

Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Without loss of generality, we can assume \(x \leq y \leq z\). 

From the constraints, we can derive the following:

- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \(x \geq 2\).
- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \(z = y + 6\).

Now, we can express the total number of coins as:
\[
x + y + z = 30
\]
Substituting \(z\) into the equation gives:
\[
x + y + (y + 6) = 30
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x + 2y + 6 = 30
\]
\[
x + 2y = 24
\]
\[
x = 24 - 2y
\]

Now, since \(x\) must be at least 2, we have:
\[
24 - 2y \geq 2
\]
\[
24 - 2 \geq 2y
\]
\[
22 \geq 2y
\]
\[
11 \geq y
\]

Since \(y\) must also be at least \(x\), we have \(y \geq 2\). Thus, \(y\) can take values from 2 to 11.

Now, we can calculate \(x\) and \(z\) for each possible value of \(y\):

- If \(y = 2\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(2) = 20\)
  - \(z = 2 + 6 = 8\) (not valid since \(x\) must be the smallest)
  
- If \(y = 3\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(3) = 18\)
  - \(z = 3 + 6 = 9\) (not valid since \(x\) must be the smallest)
  
- If \(y = 4\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(4) = 16\)
  - \(z = 4 + 6 = 10\) (not valid since \(x\) must be the smallest)
  
- If \(y = 5\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(5) = 14\)
  - \(z = 5 + 6 = 11\) (not valid since \(x\) must be the smallest)
  
- If \(y = 6\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(6) = 12\)
  - \(z = 6 + 6 = 12\) (not valid since \(x\) must be the smallest)
  
- If \(y = 7\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(7) = 10\)
  - \(z = 7 + 6 = 13\) (valid: \(x = 10\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 13\))
  
- If \(y = 8\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(8) = 8\)
  - \(z = 8 + 6 = 14\) (valid: \(x = 8\), \(y = 8\), \(z = 14\))
  
- If \(y = 9\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(9) = 6\)
  - \(z = 9 + 6 = 15\) (valid: \(x = 6\), \(y = 9\), \(z = 15\))
  
- If \(y = 10\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(10) = 4\)
  - \(z = 10 + 6 = 16\) (valid: \(x = 4\), \(y = 10\), \(z = 16\))
  
- If \(y = 11\): 
  - \(x = 24 - 2(11) = 2\)
  - \(z = 11 + 6 = 17\) (valid: \(x = 2\), \(y = 11\), \(z = 17\))

Now we have the following valid distributions:
1. \(x = 10\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 13\)
2. \(x = 8\), \(y = 8\), \(z = 14\)
3. \(x = 6\), \(y = 9\), \(z = 15\)
4. \(x = 4\), \(y = 10\), \(z = 16\)
5. \(x = 2\), \(y = 11\), \(z = 17\)

To minimize Bob's winnings, he should guess the maximum possible number of coins in each box while still ensuring he can win coins. The optimal strategy for Bob would be to guess the minimum number of coins in each box based on the distributions.

For the distribution \(x = 2\), \(y = 11\), \(z = 17\):
- If Bob guesses \(2\), \(11\), and \(17\), he will win:
  - Box 1: 2 coins (correct guess)
  - Box 2: 11 coins (correct guess)
  - Box 3: 17 coins (correct guess)
  
Total winnings = \(2 + 11 + 17 = 30\).

Thus, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$30,000**.)

Row 127: Incorrect (Expected: 536, Got: The symbols you provided are in the cuneiform script used by the ancient Mesopotamians. To convert these symbols into Arabic numerals, we need to interpret them based on the Babylonian number system, which is a base-60 (sexagesimal) system.

1. The first symbol, 𒐜, represents the number 10.
2. The second symbol, 𒐐𒐚, is a combination of two symbols:
   - 𒐐 represents the number 6.
   - 𒐚 represents the number 1.

So, 𒐐𒐚 represents the number 6 + 1 = 7.

Now, we combine these values:
- The first symbol (𒐜) represents 10 in the 60s place (10 * 60^1 = 600).
- The second symbol (𒐐𒐚) represents 7 in the 1s place (7 * 60^0 = 7).

Now, we add these two values together:
600 + 7 = 607.

Therefore, the number represented by the cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 in Arabic numerals is **607**.)

</attached_docs>
Row 153: Incorrect (Expected: green, white, Got: To determine the colors of the removed cube, we need to analyze the information provided about the Rubik's cube.

1. **Cubes with Faces**:
   - There are 6 face cubes (one colored face each).
   - There are 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each).
   - There are 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each).

2. **Cubes Found**:
   - All blue cubes have been found.
   - All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, below) have been found, along with the orange center cube.
   - All green corner cubes have been found, as well as all green cubes that border yellow.
   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found.

3. **Colors on the Cube**:
   - A standard Rubik's cube has six colors: typically white, yellow, red, orange, blue, and green.

4. **Analysis of Found Cubes**:
   - Since all blue cubes are found, there are no blue cubes left.
   - The orange center cube and its adjacent cubes are found, meaning all orange face cubes and edge cubes are accounted for.
   - All green corner cubes and green cubes bordering yellow are found, meaning all green cubes are accounted for.
   - The opposite face of the orange cubes (which is red) has also been found, meaning all red cubes are accounted for.

5. **Remaining Colors**:
   - The only colors that have not been fully accounted for are yellow and the edge cubes that are adjacent to the orange center cube.

6. **Removed Cube**:
   - The removed cube has two colored faces. Since all cubes of the other colors (blue, orange, green, red) have been found, the removed cube must be an edge cube that has two colors.
   - The only colors left that can be on the edge cubes are yellow and possibly red (but red is accounted for).

Thus, the removed cube must have the colors yellow and orange.

**Final Answer**: orange, yellow)
