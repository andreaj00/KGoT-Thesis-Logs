Therefore, the probability of the first piston firing (and thus ejecting ball 1) is 1/3.\n\nChoosing ball 1 gives you a direct chance to win if the first piston fires, while choosing balls 2 or 3 would not give you a chance to win if they are ejected first. Thus, selecting ball number 1 maximizes your odds of winning the grand prize.",

The checksum digit is calculated using an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. The goal is to identify the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two transposed columns.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Understand the ISBN-13 Validation**: The checksum for an ISBN-13 is calculated using weights of 1 and 3 for the first 12 digits. The 13th digit is the checksum digit, which should make the total sum divisible by 10.\n\n2. **Identify the Transposed Columns**: Since the problem states that two adjacent columns have been transposed, we need to check the validity of the numbers by swapping pairs of columns (from the 4th to the 11th) and see if we can find a valid checksum with a weight less than 10.\n\n3. **Calculate Checksum with Different Weights**: For each possible weight (from 2 to 9), we will calculate the checksum for each number after swapping the two columns.\n\n4. **Check Validity**: For each combination of swapped columns and weights, we will check if the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum digit.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's denote the columns as follows:\n- Column 0: 978\n- Column 1: 354181391\n- Column 2: 9 (checksum digit)\n- Column 3: 946669746\n- Column 4: 1 (checksum digit)\n- Column 5: 398036139\n- Column 6: 6 (checksum digit)\n- Column 7: 447656680\n- Column 8: 4 (checksum digit)\n- Column 9: 279586664\n- Column 10: 7 (checksum digit)\n- Column 11: 595073693\n- Column 12: 3 (checksum digit)\n- Column 13: 976647652\n- Column 14: 6 (checksum digit)\n- Column 15: 591178125\n- Column 16: 5 (checksum digit)\n- Column 17: 728465924\n- Column 18: 5 (checksum digit)\n- Column 19: 414825155\n- Column 20: 9 (checksum digit)\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nFor example, if we swap columns 4 and 5, we would have:\n- Original: 978-354181391-9\n- After swap: 978-398036139-1\n\nWe would then calculate the checksum using weights of 1 and a weight (let's say 2) for the digits in the new arrangement.\n\n### Results:\n\nAfter performing the calculations for all combinations of swapped columns and weights, we would find the valid combinations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe final output will be in the form of `x, y` where `x` is the valid weight and `y` is the smaller index of the two transposed columns. \n\nFor example, if we find that weight 3 is valid for columns 4 and 5, the output would be `3, 4`.\n\nPlease provide the specific numbers or any additional data if you need further assistance with the calculations.",

Each resident answered, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Responses**:\n   - If a resident is a human, they will tell the truth. Therefore, if they say \"At least one of us is a human,\" it is true, and they are confirming their own humanity.\n   - If a resident is a vampire, they will lie. If a vampire says \"At least one of us is a human,\" it must be false. This means that there are no humans among the residents, which contradicts the statement made by the vampire.\n\n2. **Implications**:\n   - Since all residents gave the same response, and the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" cannot be false (because if it were false, it would imply that there are no humans, which would mean all are vampires, leading to a contradiction), we can conclude that there must be at least one human in the village.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - If there is at least one human, then the rest of the residents must be vampires. However, since the statement made by all residents is consistent and true, it indicates that there is at least one human among them.\n\nGiven that there are 100 residents in total, and at least one of them is a human, the maximum number of vampires can be calculated as follows:\n\n- If there is 1 human, then there are 99 vampires.\n- If there are 2 humans, then there are 98 vampires.\n- This pattern continues until we reach the scenario where there are 100 humans and 0 vampires.\n\nHowever, since the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" must be true and cannot be contradicted by the vampires, we can conclude that there is at least one human and therefore at least one vampire.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that there is exactly **one human** and **99 vampires** in the village of \u0218irnea. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that **99 residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires**.",

One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n3. The total number of coins is 30.\n\nLet's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Without loss of generality, we can assume \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\). \n\nFrom the constraints, we can derive the following:\n\n- Since one box must contain at least 2 coins, we can set \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n- The condition that one box contains 6 more coins than another can be expressed as \\(z = y + 6\\).\n\nNow, we can express the total number of coins as:\n\\[\nx + y + z = 30\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(z\\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\nx + y + (y + 6) = 30\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx + 2y + 6 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 2y = 24\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 24 - 2y\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\(x\\) must be at least 2, we have:\n\\[\n24 - 2y \\geq 2\n\\]\n\\[\n24 - 2 \\geq 2y\n\\]\n\\[\n22 \\geq 2y\n\\]\n\\[\n11 \\geq y\n\\]\n\nSince \\(y\\) must also be at least \\(x\\), we have \\(y \\geq 2\\).
