The last two digits of the year are 11, so:\n   \\[\n   L = 11.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding \\( A \\)**:\n   As of July 2023, the TikTok logo consists of 3 colors: red, green, and blue (excluding black and white). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   A = 3.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding \\( C \\)**:\n   According to a July 2023 Business Insider article, the average height of a woman in the Philippines is approximately 152 cm. Rounding to the nearest whole centimeter gives:\n   \\[\n   C = 152.\n   \\]\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n11x = \\left( \\frac{d}{dx} (3 \\cdot x^2) \\right) + 4097 - 152.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the derivative:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} (3 \\cdot x^2) = 6x.\n\\]\n\nNow substituting this back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n11x = 6x + 4097 - 152.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[\n11x = 6x + 3945.\n\\]\n\nNow, isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n11x - 6x = 3945,\n\\]\n\\[\n5x = 3945,\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3945}{5} = 789.\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) to the nearest tenth is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{789.0}.\n\\]",
