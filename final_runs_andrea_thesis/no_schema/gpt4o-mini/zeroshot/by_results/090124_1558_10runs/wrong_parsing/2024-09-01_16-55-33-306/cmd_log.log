Solving question 15:
Query: Use density measures from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023.

I have a gallon of honey and a gallon of mayonnaise at 25C. I remove one cup of honey at a time from the gallon of honey. How many times will I need to remove a cup to have the honey weigh less than the mayonaise? Assume the containers themselves weigh the same.

Row 15: Incorrect (Expected: 6, Got: To determine how many cups of honey you need to remove for its weight to be less than that of mayonnaise, we first need to know the densities of both honey and mayonnaise.

1. **Density of Honey**: The density of honey is approximately 1.42 g/cm³.
2. **Density of Mayonnaise**: The density of mayonnaise is approximately 0.94 g/cm³.

Next, we need to convert gallons to cups and then to grams.

- **1 gallon = 16 cups**
- **1 gallon = 3,785.41 mL**
- **1 cup = 236.588 mL**

Now, let's calculate the weight of one gallon of honey and one gallon of mayonnaise.

### Weight of Honey
1. **Volume of Honey**: 1 gallon = 3,785.41 mL
2. **Weight of Honey**: 
   \[
   \text{Weight} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 3,785.41 \, \text{mL} \times 1.42 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 5,375.69 \, \text{g}
   \]

### Weight of Mayonnaise
1. **Volume of Mayonnaise**: 1 gallon = 3,785.41 mL
2. **Weight of Mayonnaise**: 
   \[
   \text{Weight} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} = 3,785.41 \, \text{mL} \times 0.94 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 3,548.68 \, \text{g}
   \]

### Initial Weights
- Weight of Honey: 5,375.69 g
- Weight of Mayonnaise: 3,548.68 g

### Removing Honey
Each cup of honey removed weighs:
\[
\text{Weight of 1 cup of honey} = 236.588 \, \text{mL} \times 1.42 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 336.21 \, \text{g}
\]

Let \( n \) be the number of cups of honey removed. The weight of honey after removing \( n \) cups is:
\[
\text{Weight of Honey after removing } n \text{ cups} = 5,375.69 \, \text{g} - n \times 336.21 \, \text{g}
\]

We want this weight to be less than the weight of mayonnaise:
\[
5,375.69 - n \times 336.21 < 3,548.68
\]

### Solving the Inequality
Rearranging the inequality:
\[
5,375.69 - 3,548.68 < n \times 336.21
\]
\[
1,827.01 < n \times 336.21
\]
\[
n > \frac{1,827.01}{336.21} \approx 5.44
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[
n = 6
\]

### Conclusion
You will need to remove **6 cups of honey** for its weight to be less than that of mayonnaise.)

Row 74: Incorrect (Expected: Shelley's place, Got: Based on the information provided, the best available place for a family that enjoys swimming and wants a full house would be **Shelley's Place**. 

Here are the reasons:

1. **Rating**: It has a rating of 4 out of 5, which indicates a good level of quality.
2. **Vacancy**: It has availability, which is essential for your stay.
3. **Pool**: It has a pool, which aligns with the family's interest in swimming.
4. **Full House**: As a rental house, it provides the space and amenities of a full house, making it suitable for a family.
