Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

1. **Identify the Green Cells**: First, we need to identify all the green cells that represent the plots owned by Earl Smith.

2. **Check Connectivity**: Next, we need to check if these green cells are connected in such a way that Earl can traverse through them without backtracking. This means that he should be able to move from one green cell to another adjacent green cell (up, down, left, or right) without revisiting any cell.

3. **Eulerian Path/Circuit**: The problem can be related to finding an Eulerian path or circuit in graph theory. An Eulerian circuit exists if all vertices (in this case, green cells) have an even degree, and an Eulerian path exists if exactly two vertices have an odd degree. If Earl starts and ends at the same cell, he needs an Eulerian circuit.

4. **Count Degrees**: For each green cell, count how many adjacent green cells it has (this gives the degree of that cell). 

5. **Determine Odd and Even Degrees**: Count how many cells have an odd degree. If there are more than two cells with an odd degree, Earl cannot complete his walk as described.

6. **Pathfinding**: If the conditions for an Eulerian path or circuit are met, Earl can walk through all his plots without backtracking.

Without the actual spreadsheet data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, you can follow these steps to analyze the green cells in your spreadsheet and determine if Earl can complete his walk as described. If you have specific coordinates or a visual representation of the green cells, I can help you analyze that further.)

Docs: []
Query with Attached Docs: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To apply Newton's Method to the function \( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \), we first need to compute its derivative:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3.
\]

Starting with the initial guess \( x_0 = -5 \), we will iteratively apply Newton's Method, which is given by the formula:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]

We will compute \( x_1 \) and subsequent iterations until the values converge to four decimal places.

### Step 1: Calculate \( f(x_0) \) and \( f'(x_0) \)

First, we calculate \( f(-5) \):

\[
f(-5) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2.
\]

Next, we calculate \( f'(-5) \):

\[
f'(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 3(25) - 40 - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( x_1 \)

Now we can compute \( x_1 \):

\[
x_1 = -5 - \frac{f(-5)}{f'(-5)} = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( f(x_1) \) and \( f'(x_1) \)

Next, we calculate \( f(-4.9375) \):

\[
f(-4.9375) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8.
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \( (-4.9375)^3 \approx -120.086 \)
2. \( 4(-4.9375)^2 \approx 4 \times 24.437 \approx 97.748 \)
3. \( -3(-4.9375) = 14.8125 \)
4. \( +8 = 8 \)

Combining these:

\[
f(-4.9375) \approx -120.086 + 97.748 + 14.8125 + 8 \approx 0.4745.
\]

Now, calculate \( f'(-4.9375) \):

\[
f'(-4.9375) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3.
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \( 3(-4.9375)^2 \approx 3 \times 24.437 \approx 73.311 \)
2. \( 8(-4.9375) \approx -39.5 \)
3. \( -3 = -3 \)

Combining these:

\[
f'(-4.9375) \approx 73.311 - 39.5 - 3 \approx 30.811.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( x_2 \)

Now we compute \( x_2 \):

\[
x_2 = -4.9375 - \frac{f(-4.9375)}{f'(-4.9375)} = -4.9375 - \frac{0.4745}{30.811} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0154 \approx -4.9529.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( f(x_2) \) and \( f'(x_2) \)

Next, we calculate \( f(-4.9529) \):

\[
f(-4.9529) \approx 0.0001 \quad (\text{after similar calculations as above}).
\]

And \( f'(-4.9529) \):

\[
f'(-4.9529) \approx 30.5 \quad (\text{after similar calculations as above}).
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \( x_3 \)

Now we compute \( x_3 \):

\[
x_3 = -4.9529 - \frac{0.0001}{30.5} \approx -4.9529 - 0.0000033 \approx -4.9529.
\]

### Step 7: Check for convergence

Now we check if \( x_3 \) and \( x_2 \) are the same when rounded to four decimal places:

\[
x_2 \approx -4.9529 \quad \text{and} \quad x_3 \approx -4.9529.
\]

Both round to \( -4.9529 \).

### Conclusion

The smallest \( n \) such that \( x_n \) and \( x_{n-1} \) are the same when rounded to four decimal places is:

\[
\boxed{3}.

Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: To decode a message encrypted with the Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A common shift is 3, but it can vary. Let's try a shift of 4, as it seems to fit the context of your message.

4. **Count Turns**: Keep a count of your turns. On the eleventh turn, note the cell you land on.

5. **Determine Cell Color**: Once you reach the cell on the eleventh turn, check the color of that cell. In Excel, you can find the color code by selecting the cell and checking the fill color in the formatting options.

6. **Convert to Hex Code**: If the color is in RGB format, convert it to a 6-digit hex code. You can use an online converter or the formula:
   - R = Red value
   - G = Green value
   - B = Blue value
   - Hex = (R * 65536 + G * 256 + B).toString(16).padStart(6, '0')

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code defines a process that generates random integers between -100 and 100 and attempts to find a value of 0. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `UhOh`: A custom exception class.
   - `Hmm`: This class initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100. The method `Yeah` checks if `value` is 0 and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay`: This function is a generator that yields new instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.

3. **Function to Keep Trying**:
   - `keep_trying`: This function takes a generator and attempts to call the `Yeah` method on the `Hmm` instance it retrieves. If `Yeah` returns `True`, it returns the `value`. If `UhOh` is raised, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - In the `__main__` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying` is called with this generator. The result is printed.

### Final Output
The code will keep generating random integers until it finds one that is 0. Since the random integers are uniformly distributed between -100 and 100, the expected output will eventually be `0`, but the time it takes to find it can vary.

Thus, the final numeric output from the code will be:

```
0
``` 

This output occurs when the `Yeah` method successfully returns `True` for a `Hmm` instance with a `value` of 0.)
