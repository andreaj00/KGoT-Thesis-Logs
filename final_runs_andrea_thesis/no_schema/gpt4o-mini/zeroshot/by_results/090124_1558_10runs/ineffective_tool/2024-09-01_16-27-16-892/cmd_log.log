Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

The key points to consider are:

1. **Path Requirements**: Earl must be able to traverse all green cells without entering any non-green cells and return to the starting point. This means he needs to create a closed loop that visits each green cell exactly once.

2. **Graph Theory**: This problem can be analyzed using concepts from graph theory. Each green cell can be considered a vertex in a graph, and each adjacent green cell can be considered an edge connecting those vertices. For Earl to return to his starting point without backtracking, the graph must be Eulerian, meaning:
   - All vertices (green cells) must have an even degree (an even number of edges connecting to them), or
   - Exactly two vertices can have an odd degree (which would be the starting and ending points of the path).

3. **Checking Degrees**: Count the number of adjacent green cells (up, down, left, right) for each green cell. This will give you the degree of each vertex.

4. **Conclusion**: If all green cells have even degrees, Earl can walk through all plots and return to the starting point. If there are exactly two green cells with odd degrees, he can still walk through all plots but will end at one of those two cells. If there are more than two cells with odd degrees, it is not possible for him to complete the walk as described.

To provide a definitive answer, you would need to analyze the specific arrangement of the green cells in the spreadsheet. If you can share the layout or describe it, I can help you determine if Earl can complete his walk as required.)

<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To apply Newton's Method to the function \( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \), we first need to compute the derivative of the function:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3
\]

We start with the initial guess \( x_0 = -5 \). The Newton's Method iteration formula is given by:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\]

We will compute the iterations until the values converge to four decimal places.

### Iteration 1: \( n = 0 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_0) \):
   \[
   f(-5) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-5) \):
   \[
   f'(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32
   \]

3. Update \( x_1 \):
   \[
   x_1 = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375
   \]

### Iteration 2: \( n = 1 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_1) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9375) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   (-4.9375)^3 \approx -120.3870, \quad 4(-4.9375)^2 \approx 97.4375, \quad -3(-4.9375) = 14.8125, \quad +8 = 8
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.9375) \approx -120.3870 + 97.4375 + 14.8125 + 8 = -0.1370
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9375) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9375)^2 \approx 73.0625, \quad 8(-4.9375) \approx -39.5, \quad -3 = -3
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) \approx 73.0625 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.5625
   \]

3. Update \( x_2 \):
   \[
   x_2 = -4.9375 - \frac{-0.1370}{30.5625} \approx -4.9375 + 0.00449 \approx -4.9330
   \]

### Iteration 3: \( n = 2 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_2) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9330) \approx (-4.9330)^3 + 4(-4.9330)^2 - 3(-4.9330) + 8
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.9330)^3 \approx -120.3090, \quad 4(-4.9330)^2 \approx 97.1930, \quad -3(-4.9330) = 14.7990, \quad +8 = 8
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.9330) \approx -120.3090 + 97.1930 + 14.7990 + 8 = -0.3160
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9330) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9330) \approx 3(-4.9330)^2 + 8(-4.9330) - 3
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9330)^2 \approx 73.0000, \quad 8(-4.9330) \approx -39.4640, \quad -3 = -3
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f'(-4.9330) \approx 73.0000 - 39.4640 - 3 = 30.5360
   \]

3. Update \( x_3 \):
   \[
   x_3 = -4.9330 - \frac{-0.3160}{30.5360} \approx -4.9330 + 0.01035 \approx -4.9227
   \]

### Iteration 4: \( n = 3 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_3) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9227) \approx (-4.9227)^3 + 4(-4.9227)^2 - 3(-4.9227) + 8
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.9227)^3 \approx -120.1740, \quad 4(-4.9227)^2 \approx 97.0250, \quad -3(-4.9227) = 14.7681, \quad +8 = 8
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.9227) \approx -120.1740 + 97.0250 + 14.7681 + 8 = -0.3809
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9227) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9227) \approx 3(-4.9227)^2 + 8(-4.9227) - 3
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9227)^2 \approx 72.8000, \quad 8(-4.9227) \approx -39.3816, \quad -3 = -3
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f'(-4.9227) \approx 72.8000 - 39.3816 - 3 = 30.4184
   \]

3. Update \( x_4 \):
   \[
   x_4 = -4.9227 - \frac{-0.3809}{30.4184} \approx -4.9227 + 0.0125 \approx -4.9102
   \]

### Iteration 5: \( n = 4 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_4) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9102) \approx (-4.9102)^3 + 4(-4.9102)^2 - 3(-4.9102) + 8
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.9102)^3 \approx -119.9990, \quad 4(-4.9102)^2 \approx 96.8000, \quad -3(-4.9102) = 14.7306, \quad +8 = 8
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.9102) \approx -119.9990 + 96.8000 + 14.7306 + 8 = -0.4684
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9102) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9102) \approx 3(-4.9102)^2 + 8(-4.9102) - 3
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9102)^2 \approx 72.0000, \quad 8(-4.9102) \approx -39.2816, \quad -3 = -3
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f'(-4.9102) \approx 72.0000 - 39.2816 - 3 = 29.7184
   \]

3. Update \( x_5 \):
   \[
   x_5 = -4.9102 - \frac{-0.4684}{29.7184} \approx -4.9102 + 0.0157 \approx -4.8945
   \]

### Iteration 6: \( n = 5 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_5) \):
   \[
   f(-4.8945) \approx (-4.8945)^3 + 4(-4.8945)^2 - 3(-4.8945) + 8
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.8945)^3 \approx -119.8000, \quad 4(-4.8945)^2 \approx 96.0000, \quad -3(-4.8945) = 14.6835, \quad +8 = 8
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.8945) \approx -119.8000 + 96.0000 + 14.6835 + 8 = -0.1165
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.8945) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.8945) \approx 3(-4.8945)^2 + 8(-4.8945) - 3
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.8945)^2 \approx 71.0000, \quad 8(-4.8945) \approx -39.0000, \quad -3 = -3
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f'(-4.8945) \approx 71.0000 - 39.0000 - 3 = 29.0000
   \]

3. Update \( x_6 \):
   \[
   x_6 = -4.8945 - \frac{-0.1165}{29.0000} \approx -4.8945 + 0.0040 \approx -4.8905
   \]

### Iteration 7: \( n = 6 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_6) \):
   \[
   f(-4.8905) \approx (-4.8905)^3 + 4(-4.8905)^2 - 3(-4.8905) + 8
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.8905)^3 \approx -119.6000, \quad 4(-4.8905)^2 \approx 95.0000, \quad -3(-4.8905) = 14.6715, \quad +8 = 8
   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.8905) \approx -119.6000 + 95.0000 + 14.6715 + 8 = -0.0285
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.8905) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.8905) \approx 3(-4.8905)^2 + 8(-4.8905) - 3
   \]

   Summing these:
   \[
   f'(-4.8905) \approx 70.0000 - 39.0000 - 3 = 28.0000
   \]

3. Update \( x_7 \):
   \[

   \]
   Summing these:
   \[
   f(-4.8895) \approx -119.5000 + 95.0000 + 14.6685 + 8 = -0.0315
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.8895) \):

Row 89: Incorrect (Expected: Picnic is in Ploybius Plaza., Got: To decode a message encrypted with the Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A common shift is 3, but it can vary. Let's try a shift of 4, as it seems to fit the context of your message.

The encrypted message is:
**Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.**

Shifting each letter back by 4 positions in the alphabet, we get:

- Z -> V
- s -> o
- m -> i
- x -> t

Putting it all together, the decoded message reads:

This still doesn't seem correct. Let's try a shift of 7 again:

- Z -> S
- s -> l

START

END
</doc>
</attached_docs>
Row 94: Incorrect (Expected: F478A7, Got: I'm unable to view or analyze the attached Excel file directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach the problem.

1. **Identify the START and END Cells**: Open the Excel file and locate the cells labeled "START" and "END". Note their coordinates (e.g., A1, B2).

2. **Understand Movement Rules**: You can move two cells in any direction (up, down, left, right) but cannot move backward or onto blue cells.

3. **Plan Your Path**: Starting from the START cell, plan your moves. Since you can only move two cells at a time, consider the possible combinations of moves that keep you within the bounds of the grid and avoid blue cells.

4. **Count Turns**: Keep track of your moves. You need to determine where you will land after 11 turns.

5. **Check Cell Color**: After determining the cell you land on after 11 turns, check the color of that cell. In Excel, you can find the hex code of a cell's color by using a VBA script or by checking the cell's formatting.

6. **Extract Hex Code**: Once you have the color, convert it to a 6-digit hex code if it’s not already in that format.

If you can provide the coordinates of the START and END cells, as well as the layout of the blue cells, I can help you devise a specific path.)

</attached_docs>
Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code defines a process that generates random integers between -100 and 100 and attempts to find a value of 0. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `UhOh`: A custom exception class.
   - `Hmm`: A class that initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100. It has a method `Yeah()` that checks if `value` is 0. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay()`: A generator that yields new instances of `Hmm`.

3. **Function to Keep Trying**:
   - `keep_trying(go, first_try=True)`: This function attempts to call the `Yeah()` method on the `Hmm` instance yielded by the generator. If `Yeah()` returns `True`, it returns the `value`. If it raises `UhOh`, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying(go)` is called, which will keep generating new `Hmm` instances until one of them has a `value` of 0.

Since the `value` is randomly generated, the output of the program will vary each time it is run. However, the final numeric output will always be `0`, as the program is designed to keep trying until it finds a `Hmm` instance where `value` is 0.

Thus, the final numeric output from the attached Python code will be:

```
0
```)
