Solving question 36:
Query: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking?

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

The key points to consider are:

1. **Path Requirements**: Earl must be able to traverse all green cells without entering any non-green cells and return to the starting point. This means he needs to create a closed loop that visits each green cell exactly once.

2. **Graph Theory**: This problem can be analyzed using concepts from graph theory. Each green cell can be considered a vertex in a graph, and each adjacent pair of green cells can be considered an edge. For Earl to return to his starting point without backtracking, the graph must be Eulerian, meaning:
   - All vertices (green cells) must have an even degree (an even number of edges connecting to them), or
   - Exactly two vertices can have an odd degree (which would be the starting and ending points of the path).

3. **Checking Degrees**: We would need to count the number of adjacent green cells (degree) for each green cell. If all green cells have even degrees, Earl can create a closed loop. If there are exactly two cells with odd degrees, he can create a path that starts at one and ends at the other.

4. **Connectivity**: All green cells must be connected, meaning there should be a path between any two green cells without having to leave the green cells.

To conclude, you would need to analyze the specific arrangement of the green cells in the spreadsheet to check the degrees of each cell and their connectivity. If the conditions for an Eulerian path or circuit are met, then Earl can walk through all his plots and return to the starting point without backtracking. If not, then it would not be possible. 

If you can provide the specific layout or a description of the green cells, I can help you analyze it further.)

Solving question 85:
Query: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?

Query with Attached Docs: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To apply Newton's Method to the function \( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \), we first need to compute its derivative:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3.
\]

Starting with the initial guess \( x_0 = -5 \), we will use the Newton's Method formula:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]

We will compute the iterations until the values converge to four decimal places.

### Iteration 1: \( n = 0 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_0) \):
   \[
   f(-5) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-5) \):
   \[
   f'(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32.
   \]

3. Update \( x_1 \):
   \[
   x_1 = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375.
   \]

### Iteration 2: \( n = 1 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_1) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9375) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8.
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   (-4.9375)^3 \approx -120.1162,
   \]
   \[
   4(-4.9375)^2 \approx 97.4375,
   \]
   \[
   -3(-4.9375) = 14.8125,
   \]
   \[
   f(-4.9375) \approx -120.1162 + 97.4375 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.1338.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9375) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9375)^2 \approx 73.0625,
   \]
   \[
   8(-4.9375) = -39.5,
   \]
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) \approx 73.0625 - 39.5 - 3 = 30.5625.
   \]

3. Update \( x_2 \):
   \[
   x_2 = -4.9375 - \frac{0.1338}{30.5625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0044 \approx -4.9331.
   \]

### Iteration 3: \( n = 2 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_2) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9331) \approx (-4.9331)^3 + 4(-4.9331)^2 - 3(-4.9331) + 8.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.9331)^3 \approx -120.0865,
   \]
   \[
   4(-4.9331)^2 \approx 97.3085,
   \]
   \[
   -3(-4.9331) = 14.7993,
   \]
   \[
   f(-4.9331) \approx -120.0865 + 97.3085 + 14.7993 + 8 = 0.0213.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9331) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9331) \approx 3(-4.9331)^2 + 8(-4.9331) - 3.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9331)^2 \approx 73.0325,
   \]
   \[
   8(-4.9331) = -39.4648,
   \]
   \[
   f'(-4.9331) \approx 73.0325 - 39.4648 - 3 = 30.5677.
   \]

3. Update \( x_3 \):
   \[
   x_3 = -4.9331 - \frac{0.0213}{30.5677} \approx -4.9331 - 0.0007 \approx -4.9324.
   \]

### Iteration 4: \( n = 3 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_3) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9324) \approx (-4.9324)^3 + 4(-4.9324)^2 - 3(-4.9324) + 8.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.9324)^3 \approx -120.0791,
   \]
   \[
   4(-4.9324)^2 \approx 97.2925,
   \]
   \[
   -3(-4.9324) = 14.7972,
   \]
   \[
   f(-4.9324) \approx -120.0791 + 97.2925 + 14.7972 + 8 = 0.0106.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9324) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9324) \approx 3(-4.9324)^2 + 8(-4.9324) - 3.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9324)^2 \approx 73.0255,
   \]
   \[
   8(-4.9324) = -39.4592,
   \]
   \[
   f'(-4.9324) \approx 73.0255 - 39.4592 - 3 = 30.5663.
   \]

3. Update \( x_4 \):
   \[
   x_4 = -4.9324 - \frac{0.0106}{30.5663} \approx -4.9324 - 0.0003 \approx -4.9321.
   \]

### Iteration 5: \( n = 4 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_4) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9321) \approx (-4.9321)^3 + 4(-4.9321)^2 - 3(-4.9321) + 8.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   (-4.9321)^3 \approx -120.0771,
   \]
   \[
   4(-4.9321)^2 \approx 97.2901,
   \]
   \[
   -3(-4.9321) = 14.7963,
   \]
   \[
   f(-4.9321) \approx -120.0771 + 97.2901 + 14.7963 + 8 = 0.0023.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9321) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9321) \approx 3(-4.9321)^2 + 8(-4.9321) - 3.
   \]
   Calculating:
   \[
   3(-4.9321)^2 \approx 73.0241,
   \]
   \[
   8(-4.9321) = -39.4576,
   \]
   \[
   f'(-4.9321) \approx 73.0241 - 39.4576 - 3 = 30.5665.
   \]

3. Update \( x_5 \):
   \[
   x_5 = -4.9321 - \frac{0.0023}{30.5665} \approx -4.9321 - 0.000075 \approx -4.9321.
   \]

### Conclusion

After rounding to four decimal places, we find that \( x_5 \) is still \( -4.9321 \). The values are converging, and we can see that the change is becoming negligible.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) such that the values converge to four decimal places is:

\[
\boxed{5}.

Solving question 94:
Query: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?

START

END
</doc>
</attached_docs>
Row 94: Incorrect (Expected: F478A7, Got: I'm unable to view or analyze the attached Excel file directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach the problem.

1. **Identify the START and END Cells**: Open the Excel file and locate the cells labeled "START" and "END". Note their coordinates (e.g., A1, B2).

2. **Understand Movement Rules**: You can move two cells in any direction (up, down, left, right) but cannot move backward or onto blue cells.

3. **Plan Your Path**: Starting from the START cell, plan your moves. Since you can only move two cells at a time, consider the possible combinations of moves that keep you within the bounds of the grid and avoid blue cells.

4. **Count Turns**: Keep track of your moves. You need to determine where you will be after 11 turns.

5. **Check Cell Color**: After determining the cell you land on after 11 turns, check the color of that cell. In Excel, you can find the hex code of a cell's color by using the following method:
   - Right-click on the cell and select "Format Cells".
   - Go to the "Fill" tab to see the color.
   - If you need the hex code, you may need to use a color picker tool or convert the RGB values to hex.

6. **Output the Hex Code**: Once you have the hex code, write it down without any prefix.

If you can provide the coordinates of the START and END cells or describe the layout of the map, I can help you further with the pathfinding.)

</attached_docs>
Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code defines a process that generates random integers between -100 and 100 and attempts to find a value of 0. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `UhOh`: A custom exception class.
   - `Hmm`: This class initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100. The method `Yeah` checks if `value` is 0 and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay`: This is a generator function that yields new instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.

3. **Function to Keep Trying**:
   - `keep_trying`: This function takes a generator and attempts to call the `Yeah` method on the `Hmm` instance it retrieves. If `Yeah` returns `True`, it returns the `value`. If it raises `UhOh`, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying(go)` is called, which will keep generating new `Hmm` instances until one of them has a `value` of 0.

Since the `value` is randomly generated, the output of the program will be `0` when the first instance of `Hmm` with a `value` of 0 is created. The program will print "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." each time it fails to find a `value` of 0, but it will eventually succeed.

Thus, the final numeric output from the attached Python code will be:

```
0
```)
