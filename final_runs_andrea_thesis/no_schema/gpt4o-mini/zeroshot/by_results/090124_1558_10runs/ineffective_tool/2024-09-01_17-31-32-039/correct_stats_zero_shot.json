        "returned_answer": "To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Path Connectivity**: Earl must be able to move from one green cell to another without stepping on any non-green cells. This means that all green cells must be connected in such a way that he can traverse them without leaving the green area.\n\n2. **Eulerian Path/Circuit**: For Earl to walk through every plot and return to the starting plot without backtracking, the configuration of the green cells must allow for an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit exists if:\n   - All vertices (in this case, green cells) have an even degree (an even number of adjacent green cells).\n   - The graph is connected (all green cells can be reached from one another).\n\n3. **Degree of Cells**: The degree of a cell is determined by how many adjacent green cells it has. Earl can only return to his starting point if he can traverse each green cell exactly once and return to the starting cell.\n\nTo analyze the specific layout of the green cells, you would need to:\n\n- Count the number of adjacent green cells for each green cell (this gives the degree).\n- Check if all green cells are connected.\n- Verify if all green cells have an even degree.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If any of these conditions fail, then it would not be possible.\n\nSince I cannot view the attached spreadsheet, you would need to perform this analysis based on the layout of the green cells in your document. If you provide a description or a visual representation of the layout, I can help you further analyze it.",

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. **Class Definitions**:\n   - `UhOh`: A custom exception class.\n   - `Hmm`: This class initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100. The method `Yeah` checks if `value` is 0 and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.\n\n2. **Generator Function**:\n   - `Okay`: This function is a generator that yields new instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.\n\n3. **Function to Keep Trying**:\n   - `keep_trying`: This function takes a generator and attempts to call the `Yeah` method on the `Hmm` instances it generates. If `Yeah` returns `True`, it returns the `value`. If `UhOh` is raised, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.\n\n4. **Main Execution**:\n   - In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying(go)` is called, which will keep generating `Hmm` instances until it finds one where `value` is 0.\n\nSince the `value` is randomly generated, the output of the program will be `0` when the `Yeah` method successfully returns `True`. The program will keep trying until it finds a `Hmm` instance with `value` equal to 0, which is guaranteed to happen eventually due to the nature of random number generation within the specified range.\n\nThus, the final numeric output from the attached Python code will be:\n\n```\n0\n```",
