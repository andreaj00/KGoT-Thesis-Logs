Solving question 36:
Query: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

The key points to consider are:

1. **Path Connectivity**: Earl must be able to move from one green cell to another without stepping on any non-green cells. This means that all green cells must be connected in such a way that he can traverse them without leaving the green area.

2. **Eulerian Circuit**: For Earl to return to his starting plot without backtracking, the path he takes must form an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit exists in a graph if:
   - All vertices (in this case, green cells) have an even degree (an even number of edges connecting to them).
   - All vertices with non-zero degree are connected.

3. **Degree of Cells**: The degree of a cell is determined by how many adjacent green cells it has (up, down, left, right). Earl can only traverse through green cells, so we need to count the degree of each green cell.

4. **Connected Components**: We must ensure that all green cells are part of a single connected component. If there are isolated green cells, Earl cannot traverse through all of them.

To analyze the situation, you would typically:

- Identify all the green cells and their connections.
- Count the degree of each green cell.
- Check if all green cells are connected.

If all green cells are connected and each has an even degree, then Earl can walk through every plot he owns and return to his starting plot without backtracking. If any green cell has an odd degree or if there are disconnected green cells, then he cannot complete the walk as described.

Since I cannot view the attached spreadsheet, you would need to perform this analysis based on the layout of the green cells in your document. If you provide a description of the layout or the degree of each green cell, I can help you further with the analysis.)

Solving question 85:
Query: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?

Query with Attached Docs: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To apply Newton's Method to the function \( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \), we first need to compute its derivative:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3.
\]

Starting with the initial guess \( x_0 = -5 \), we will use the Newton's Method formula:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]

We will compute the iterations until the values converge to four decimal places.

### Iteration 1: \( n = 0 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_0) \):
   \[
   f(-5) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-5) \):
   \[
   f'(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32.
   \]

3. Update \( x_1 \):
   \[
   x_1 = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375.
   \]

### Iteration 2: \( n = 1 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_1) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9375) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8.
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   (-4.9375)^3 \approx -120.1220,
   \]
   \[
   4(-4.9375)^2 \approx 97.4375,
   \]
   \[
   -3(-4.9375) = 14.8125,
   \]
   \[
   f(-4.9375) \approx -120.1220 + 97.4375 + 14.8125 + 8 = 0.1280.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9375) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3.
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   3(-4.9375)^2 \approx 73.0625,
   \]
   \[
   8(-4.9375) \approx -39.5000,
   \]
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) \approx 73.0625 - 39.5000 - 3 = 30.5625.
   \]

3. Update \( x_2 \):
   \[
   x_2 = -4.9375 - \frac{0.1280}{30.5625} \approx -4.9375 - 0.0042 \approx -4.9333.
   \]

### Iteration 3: \( n = 2 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_2) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9333) \approx (-4.9333)^3 + 4(-4.9333)^2 - 3(-4.9333) + 8.
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   (-4.9333)^3 \approx -120.0860,
   \]
   \[
   4(-4.9333)^2 \approx 97.3078,
   \]
   \[
   -3(-4.9333) = 14.7999,
   \]
   \[
   f(-4.9333) \approx -120.0860 + 97.3078 + 14.7999 + 8 = 0.0217.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9333) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9333) \approx 3(-4.9333)^2 + 8(-4.9333) - 3.
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   \[
   3(-4.9333)^2 \approx 73.0000,
   \]
   \[
   8(-4.9333) \approx -39.4664,
   \]
   \[
   f'(-4.9333) \approx 73.0000 - 39.4664 - 3 = 30.5336.
   \]

3. Update \( x_3 \):
   \[
   x_3 = -4.9333 - \frac{0.0217}{30.5336} \approx -4.9333 - 0.0007 \approx -4.9326.
   \]

### Iteration 4: \( n = 3 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_3) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9326) \approx 0.0001.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9326) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9326) \approx 30.5320.
   \]

3. Update \( x_4 \):
   \[
   x_4 = -4.9326 - \frac{0.0001}{30.5320} \approx -4.9326 - 0.0000033 \approx -4.9326.
   \]

### Conclusion

After rounding to four decimal places, we see that \( x_3 \) and \( x_4 \) are the same. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) such that the values converge to four decimal places is:

\[
\boxed{3}.

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: The provided Python code defines a process that generates random integers between -100 and 100 and attempts to find a value of 0. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `UhOh`: A custom exception class.
   - `Hmm`: This class initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100. The method `Yeah` checks if `value` is 0 and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay`: This is a generator function that yields new instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.

3. **Function to Keep Trying**:
   - `keep_trying`: This function takes a generator and attempts to call the `Yeah` method on the `Hmm` instance it retrieves. If `Yeah` returns `True`, it returns the `value`. If `UhOh` is raised, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying(go)` is called, which will keep generating new `Hmm` instances until one of them has a `value` of 0.

Since the `value` is randomly generated, the output of the program will be `0` when the first instance of `Hmm` with a `value` of 0 is created. The program will print "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." each time it fails to find a `value` of 0, but it will eventually succeed.

Thus, the final numeric output from the attached Python code will be:

```
0
```)
