Solving question 36:
Query: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Row 36: Incorrect (Expected: No, Got: To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.

The key points to consider are:

1. **Path Connectivity**: Earl must be able to move from one green cell to another without stepping on any non-green cells. This means that all green cells must be connected in such a way that he can traverse them without leaving the green area.

2. **Eulerian Path/Circuit**: For Earl to walk through every plot he owns and return to the starting plot without backtracking, the layout of the green cells must allow for an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit exists if:
   - All vertices (in this case, green cells) have an even degree (an even number of adjacent green cells).
   - The graph is connected (all green cells can be reached from one another).

3. **Degree of Cells**: The degree of a cell is determined by how many adjacent green cells it has. Earl can only return to his starting point if he starts and ends on a cell with an even degree.

To analyze the situation, you would typically:

- Count the number of adjacent green cells for each green cell (degree).
- Check if all green cells are connected.
- Ensure that all green cells have an even degree.

If you can provide the specific layout or a description of the green cells, I can help you analyze it further to determine if Earl can complete his walk as described.)

Solving question 85:
Query: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?
Docs: []
Query with Attached Docs: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?
<attached_docs>

</attached_docs>
Row 85: Incorrect (Expected: 2, Got: To apply Newton's Method to the function \( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \), we first need to compute its derivative:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 3.
\]

Starting with the initial guess \( x_0 = -5 \), we will use the Newton's Method formula:

\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]

We will compute the iterations until the values converge to four decimal places.

### Iteration 1: \( n = 0 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_0) \):
   \[
   f(-5) = (-5)^3 + 4(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 8 = -125 + 100 + 15 + 8 = -2.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-5) \):
   \[
   f'(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 8(-5) - 3 = 75 - 40 - 3 = 32.
   \]

3. Update \( x_1 \):
   \[
   x_1 = -5 - \frac{-2}{32} = -5 + \frac{1}{16} = -5 + 0.0625 = -4.9375.
   \]

### Iteration 2: \( n = 1 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_1) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9375) = (-4.9375)^3 + 4(-4.9375)^2 - 3(-4.9375) + 8.
   \]
   First, calculate \( (-4.9375)^2 \) and \( (-4.9375)^3 \):
   \[
   (-4.9375)^2 = 24.437890625,
   \]
   \[
   (-4.9375)^3 = -121.173828125.
   \]
   Now substitute:
   \[
   f(-4.9375) = -121.173828125 + 4(24.437890625) + 14.8125 + 8 = -121.173828125 + 97.7515625 + 14.8125 + 8 = -0.610765625.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9375) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9375) = 3(-4.9375)^2 + 8(-4.9375) - 3 = 3(24.437890625) - 39 - 3 = 73.313671875 - 42 = 31.313671875.
   \]

3. Update \( x_2 \):
   \[
   x_2 = -4.9375 - \frac{-0.610765625}{31.313671875} \approx -4.9375 + 0.0195 \approx -4.9180.
   \]

### Iteration 3: \( n = 2 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_2) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9180) = (-4.9180)^3 + 4(-4.9180)^2 - 3(-4.9180) + 8.
   \]
   Calculate \( (-4.9180)^2 \) and \( (-4.9180)^3 \):
   \[
   (-4.9180)^2 \approx 24.218724,
   \]
   \[
   (-4.9180)^3 \approx -119.646.
   \]
   Substitute:
   \[
   f(-4.9180) \approx -119.646 + 4(24.218724) + 14.754 + 8 \approx -119.646 + 96.874896 + 14.754 + 8 \approx -0.017104.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9180) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9180) = 3(-4.9180)^2 + 8(-4.9180) - 3 \approx 3(24.218724) - 39.344 - 3 \approx 72.656172 - 42.344 \approx 30.312172.
   \]

3. Update \( x_3 \):
   \[
   x_3 = -4.9180 - \frac{-0.017104}{30.312172} \approx -4.9180 + 0.000564 \approx -4.9174.
   \]

### Iteration 4: \( n = 3 \)

1. Calculate \( f(x_3) \):
   \[
   f(-4.9174) \approx -0.0001 \text{ (after similar calculations)}.
   \]

2. Calculate \( f'(-4.9174) \):
   \[
   f'(-4.9174) \approx 30.312.
   \]

3. Update \( x_4 \):
   \[
   x_4 = -4.9174 - \frac{-0.0001}{30.312} \approx -4.9174 + 0.0000033 \approx -4.9174.
   \]

### Conclusion

After rounding to four decimal places, we find that \( x_3 \) and \( x_4 \) are both approximately \( -4.9174 \). Since the values do not change after rounding, we conclude that the smallest \( n \) such that \( x_n \) rounds to the same value is:

\[
\boxed{3}.

Solving question 94:
Query: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?

Row 94: Incorrect (Expected: F478A7, Got: I'm unable to view or analyze the attached Excel file directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach the problem.

1. **Identify the START and END Cells**: Open the Excel file and locate the cells labeled "START" and "END". Note their coordinates (e.g., A1, B2).

2. **Understand Movement Rules**: You can move two cells in any direction (up, down, left, right) but cannot move backward or onto blue cells.

3. **Plan Your Path**: Starting from the START cell, plan your moves. Since you can only move two cells at a time, consider the possible combinations of moves that keep you within the bounds of the grid and avoid blue cells.

4. **Count Turns**: Keep track of your moves. You need to determine where you will land after 11 turns.

5. **Check Cell Color**: After determining the cell you land on after 11 turns, check the color of that cell. In Excel, you can find the hex code of a cell's color by using a VBA script or by checking the cell's formatting.

6. **Extract Hex Code**: Once you have the color, convert it to a 6-digit hex code if it’s not already in that format.

If you can provide the coordinates of the START and END cells, as well as the layout of the blue cells, I can help you devise a specific path to take.)

Row 119: Incorrect (Expected: 0, Got: To determine the final numeric output from the provided Python code, let's analyze how it works step by step.

1. **Class Definitions**:
   - `UhOh` is a custom exception.
   - `Hmm` is a class that initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100. It has a method `Yeah()` that checks if `value` is 0. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.

2. **Generator Function**:
   - `Okay()` is a generator that yields new instances of `Hmm` indefinitely.

3. **Function `keep_trying`**:
   - This function takes a generator `go` and attempts to call the `Yeah()` method on the next instance of `Hmm`.
   - If `Yeah()` returns `True`, it returns the `value` of that instance.
   - If `Yeah()` raises `UhOh`, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before recursively calling itself to try again with a new instance of `Hmm`.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the generator `go` is created by calling `Okay()`, and `keep_trying(go)` is called, which will keep trying to find an instance of `Hmm` where `value` is 0.

### Output Analysis:
- The code will keep generating new instances of `Hmm` until it finds one where `value` is 0.
- Since `value` is randomly generated between -100 and 100, the probability of hitting 0 is 1 in 201 (since there are 201 possible values: -100 to 100 inclusive).
- The function will print "Working..." and "Please wait patiently..." each time it encounters a non-zero value before sleeping for 0.1 seconds.

### Final Output:
- The final output will be `0`, as that is the only value that will cause the `Yeah()` method to return `True` and exit the loop in `keep_trying`.

Thus, the final numeric output from the code will be:

```
0
```)
