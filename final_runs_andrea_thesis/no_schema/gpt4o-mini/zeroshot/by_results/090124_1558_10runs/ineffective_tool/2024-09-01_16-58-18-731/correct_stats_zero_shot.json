        "returned_answer": "To determine if Earl Smith can walk through every plot he owns (green cells) and return to his starting plot without backtracking, we need to analyze the layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet.\n\n1. **Identify the Green Cells**: First, we need to identify all the green cells that represent the plots owned by Earl Smith.\n\n2. **Check Connectivity**: We need to ensure that all green cells are connected in such a way that Earl can move from one to another without leaving any green cell unvisited.\n\n3. **Eulerian Path/Circuit**: The problem can be framed in terms of graph theory. Earl can walk through all the plots without backtracking if there exists an Eulerian circuit (a path that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting point). For an Eulerian circuit to exist, all vertices (in this case, green cells) must have an even degree (an even number of edges connecting to them).\n\n4. **Count Degrees**: For each green cell, count how many adjacent green cells it has (up, down, left, right). If all green cells have an even degree, then an Eulerian circuit exists.\n\n5. **Path Analysis**: If any green cell has an odd degree, then Earl can still walk through all plots without backtracking, but he would not be able to return to the starting point.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: If all green cells have even degrees, Earl can walk through all plots and return to the starting plot without backtracking. If there are any odd-degree cells, he can walk through all plots but will not be able to return to the starting plot without backtracking.\n\nTo provide a definitive answer, I would need to analyze the specific layout of the green cells in the spreadsheet. If you can describe the arrangement or provide the coordinates of the green cells, I can help you determine the answer.",

The method `Yeah` checks if `value` is 0 and returns `True` if it is; otherwise, it raises the `UhOh` exception.\n\n2. **Generator Function**:\n   - `Okay`: This is a generator function that yields new instances of the `Hmm` class indefinitely.\n\n3. **Function to Keep Trying**:\n   - `keep_trying`: This function takes a generator and attempts to call the `Yeah` method on the `Hmm` instance it retrieves. If `Yeah` returns `True`, it returns the `value`. If `UhOh` is raised, it prints messages and waits for 0.1 seconds before trying again.\n\n4. **Main Execution**:\n   - In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, the generator `go` is created, and `keep_trying(go)` is called, which will keep generating new `Hmm` instances until one of them has a `value` of 0.\n\nSince the `value` is randomly generated, the output of the program will be `0` when the first instance of `Hmm` with a `value` of 0 is created. The program will print \"Working...\" and \"Please wait patiently...\" each time it fails to find a `value` of 0, but it will eventually succeed.\n\nThus, the final numeric output from the attached Python code will be:\n\n```\n0\n```",
