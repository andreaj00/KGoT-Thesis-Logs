Each cell phone tower can cover houses within a 4-mile radius.\n\nLet's break down the positions of the houses based on the layout:\n\n1. The first row indicates houses at the following mile markers:\n   - Mile 0: H\n   - Mile 1: H\n   - Mile 2: H\n   - Mile 3: (no house)\n   - Mile 4: H\n   - Mile 5: (no house)\n   - Mile 6: H\n   - Mile 7: (no house)\n   - Mile 8: H\n\n2.

A tower placed at a mile marker can cover houses from 4 miles before to 4 miles after that marker.\n\nTo minimize the number of towers, we can strategically place them to maximize coverage:\n\n1. **Place a tower at mile 4**: This tower will cover:\n   - From mile 0 to mile 8 (covers all houses).\n\nSince placing a tower at mile 4 covers all the houses, we only need **1 cell phone tower** to cover all the houses next to the road.\n\nThus, the minimum number of cell phone towers needed is:\n\n**1**",
