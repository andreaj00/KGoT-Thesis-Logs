{"type":"node","id":"28","labels":["Information"],"properties":{"description":"The article does not provide specific information about the average refund or deposit amount for recycling plastic water bottles in the U.S. as of May 2023. However, it mentions that container deposit legislation mandates refunds for the return of certain containers—typically glass, plastic, and metal. These programs have succeeded in creating an average 80% recycling rate. To calculate the refund for your trip, we need to determine the distance from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via I-40 and then from Cincinnati to Augusta via I-90. The approximate distance from Los Angeles to Cincinnati is about 1,800 miles, and from Cincinnati to Augusta is about 800 miles, totaling approximately 2,600 miles. You drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles traveled. Therefore, for 2,600 miles, you would consume: (2,600 miles / 100 miles) * 5 bottles = 130 bottles. Assuming a typical deposit of $0.05 per bottle (a common amount in many states), the total refund would be: 130 bottles * $0.05 = $6.50. Thus, you would get back approximately $6.50 for recycling your water bottles during your trip."}}
