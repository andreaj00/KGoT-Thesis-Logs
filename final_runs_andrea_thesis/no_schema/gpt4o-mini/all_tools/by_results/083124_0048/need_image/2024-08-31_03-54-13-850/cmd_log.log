OCR text: Arithmetic [ edit I edit source]
Arithmetic has to deal with elementary/basic levels of math, such as division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. Basically, just working with numbers.
This SHOULD be a level familiar with you. If you are not familiar with arithmetic math/rules, then PLEASE review through Arithmetic as you won't survive even the 1st step of Algebra. Trust me, the basics are THAT important.
Fractions [ edit I edit source
Fractions (from Latin fractus, "broken") are parts of a whole. In the image of a cake, there is only 3/4's of the cake showing, the other 1/4 has been eaten/taken away.
The number, 3. in 3/4, is what is known as a numerator (Numerator: Number at the top, tells us of how much of the number is being talked about/being used). The number, 4. in 3/4, is what
is known as a denominator (Denominator: Number showing the all time total).
Simplest form/reduced form
A reduced form of a fraction is a fraction that cannot be divided by any number other than 1, and the denominator is greater than 1. So 2/4 is NOT in simplest form. since we can divide 2
and 4. by 2... which results in the following number: 1/2 Though not every fraction can be divided by 2, there are fractions, such as: 5/35 7/21. and 30/5. The two first fractions are not
divisible by 2, and 30/5 can not be divided by 2 on both sides, but only on 30. It's important to simplify as if you were in a test, your teacher will mark your problems as incorrect if you didn't
A Cake with fractions
4 x 3 12 (multiplication)
simplify your fractions It's also important to note that a simplified fraction and the non-simplified fraction (that, if simplified, equals that fraction) are the same, and represent the same
quantity. So, 2 and 2 represents the same quantity, a half!
Here, we will present a few fractions for you to simplify.

Solving question 103:
file_names: ['cca70ce6-1952-45d2-acd4-80c903b0bc49.png']
Query with Attached paths: Look at the attached image. The quiz is scored as follows:

Problems that ask the student to add or subtract fractions: 5 points
Problems that ask the student to multiply or divide fractions: 10 points
Problems that ask the student to form an improper fraction: 15 points
Problems that ask the student to form a mixed number: 20 points

Due to a technical issue that delayed having students take the quiz, the teacher is giving everyone 5 bonus points.

If you graded the quiz in the attached image, how many points would the student have earned? There is no partial credit.

returned next step INSERT, The current plan allows for 2 TB of storage, which is equivalent to 2000 GB. You have uploaded 60 files, and since you are 100 GB over the limit, it means the total size of the uploaded files is 2100 GB. Therefore, each file is 2100 GB / 60 files = 35 GB per file. You have 980 more files to upload, which will add an additional 980 * 35 GB = 34300 GB. The total storage needed will be 2100 GB + 34300 GB = 36400 GB. The minimum plan that can accommodate this is the Premium Plan, which offers 50 TB (50000 GB) of storage for $39.99. The cost difference between the Premium Plan and the Standard Plan is $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00. The average additional cost per file for the 1040 files (60 already uploaded + 980 more) is $30.00 / 1040 files = $0.02884615384615384, which rounds to $0.03 per file.
returned next step INSERT, The current plan allows for 2 TB of storage, which is equivalent to 2000 GB. You have uploaded 60 files, and since you are 100 GB over the limit, it means you have used 2100 GB. Each of the 60 files is therefore approximately 35 GB (2100 GB / 60 files). You have 980 more files to upload, which will require an additional 34300 GB (980 files * 35 GB/file). The minimum plan that can accommodate this is the Premium Plan, which offers 50 TB (50000 GB) of storage for $39.99. The total storage needed is 2100 GB + 34300 GB = 36400 GB. The additional cost for the Premium Plan is $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00. The average additional cost per file for the 980 files is $30.00 / 980 = $0.0306122449, which rounds to $0.03 per file.

The additional cost for the 980 files is $39.99 - $9.99 (the cost of the Standard Plan) = $30.00. The average additional cost per file is $30.00 / 980 files = $0.0306122449, rounded to the nearest cent is $0.03.
returned next step INSERT, The current plan allows for 2 TB of storage, which is equivalent to 2000 GB. You have uploaded 60 files, and since you are 100 GB over the limit, it means you have used 2100 GB. Each of the 60 files is therefore approximately 35 GB in size (2100 GB / 60 files). You have 980 more files to upload, which will require an additional 34300 GB (980 files * 35 GB/file). The minimum plan that can accommodate this is the Premium Plan, which offers 50 TB (50000 GB) of storage for $39.99. The total cost for the Premium Plan is $39.99. The average additional cost per file for the 980 files is calculated as follows: Total cost of Premium Plan - Cost of Standard Plan = $39.99 - $9.99 = $30.00. Therefore, the average additional cost per file is $30.00 / 980 = $0.0306122449, rounded to the nearest cent is $0.03.

The additional cost for the 980 files is $39.99 - $9.99 (the cost of the Standard Plan) = $30.00. The average additional cost per file is $30.00 / 980 files = $0.0306122449, which rounds to $0.03 per file.
Reason to insert: The current plan allows for 2 TB of storage (2000 GB), but you have already uploaded 60 files totaling 2100 GB, which is 100 GB over the limit. Each file is approximately 35 GB, and with 980 more files to upload, you will need an additional 34300 GB, bringing the total storage requirement to 36400 GB. The Premium Plan, offering 50 TB (50000 GB) for $39.99, is the only option that can accommodate this need. The additional cost for upgrading from the Standard Plan is $30.00, resulting in an average additional cost of about $0.03 per file for the total of 1040 files.

Reason to insert: The existing queries in the Neo4j database are repetitive and do not provide new insights, as they all attempt to retrieve the same information about the '2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition Chinese zodiac' and its associated animals, specifically their names and hand visibility. Additionally, there is a minor inconsistency in one query where 'hand_visible' is incorrectly referenced as 'has_hand_visible', but overall, the lack of diverse queries limits the ability to extract meaningful data.
