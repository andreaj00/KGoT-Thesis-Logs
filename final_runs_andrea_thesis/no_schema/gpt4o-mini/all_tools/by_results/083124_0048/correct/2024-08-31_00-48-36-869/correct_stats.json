        "returned_answer": "In social and political discussions, \"right\" can refer to a political ideology or group, such as \"right-wing\" politics which emphasize tradition, hierarchy, and free market principles, contrasting with \"left-wing\" politics that advocate for social equality and government intervention. In legal terms, \"right\" refers to entitlements or privileges granted by law, for example: \"Everyone has the right to a fair trial.\" and \"Property rights protect individuals' ownership of their possessions.\" In moral or ethical discussions, \"right\" refers to actions, decisions, or principles that are considered morally good, just, or acceptable, contrasting with \"wrong.\" For instance: \"It is right to help those in need.\" and \"Lying is generally considered wrong, while telling the truth is seen as the right thing to do.\" This context also relates to human rights, which are fundamental rights every individual is entitled to, such as the right to free speech, the right to education, and the right to equality. In terms of correctness or accuracy, \"right\" signifies something that is true, correct, or appropriate, often applied in academic, logical, or practical contexts, such as: \"Your answer to the math problem is right.\" and \"It\u2019s right to follow the rules in this situation.\" In this sense, \"right\" can imply a standard or norm against which something is measured, like a \"right\" answer in a test. Lastly, in the context of direction, \"right\" refers to one of the cardinal directions, opposite of \"left,\" indicating a turn or movement towards the right side, for example: \"Turn right at the next intersection.\" and \"The store is on your right.\"",
